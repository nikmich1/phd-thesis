In this thesis, several aspects of nuclear structure effects in the spectra of hydrogen-like systems are investigated in the framework of bound-state quantum electrodynamics. The first part of this thesis is about the $g$ factor of a bound electron, which depends on the shape of the nuclear charge distribution. 
A numerical, non-perturbative approach for the calculation of the corresponding nuclear shape correction is presented and implications for the uncertainties of theoretical predictions are discussed. In particular, the model-uncertainty of the finite-nuclear-size correction to the $g$ factor can be reduced using information on the deformed charge distribution.
The second part is about the structure of bound states between a muon and an atomic nucleus, so called muonic atoms. Here, high-precision calculations for transition energies and probabilities are presented, using up-to-date numerical methods. Furthermore, new methods for the calculation of higher order corrections for the hyperfine structure are presented. This includes a complete calculation of the second order hyperfine structure and leading order vacuum polarization corrections for extended electric quadrupole distributions inside the nucleus.
High-precision calculations for the bound-muon $g$ factor in $^{4}$He are perfomed and in connection with recent measurements on muonic atoms, the nuclear quadrupole moment of $^{185}$Re and $^{187}$Re is extracted.
