The long--lived nuclear excited state ${}^{93\mathrm{m}}$Mo can be produced in $^{93}_{41}$Nb(p,n)$^{93\mathrm{m}}_{\phantom{m} 42}$Mo reactions. In this way it is possible to create the isomers directly implanted into solid--state niobium foils used as target in the considered XFEL scenario. Cross sections for the isomer production have already been measured experimentally in several works \cite{Blazer1951,Kiselev1974,Levkovskij,Singh2006,AvilaRodriguez2008,Ditroi2008,Ditroi2009} and are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:isomer.cs} as a function of the impinging proton energy.

We estimate the ${}^{93\mathrm{m}}$Mo production rate according to
\begin{equation}
I[{}^{93\mathrm{m}}\mathrm{Mo}] = \frac{N_{\rm{A}} \rho L}{A} \sigma \Phi \epsilon,
\label{eq:rate}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ represents the reaction cross section, $\Phi$ the proton flux and $\epsilon$ the transmission efficiency. The  factor  $N_{\rm{A}} \rho L/A$ denotes the area density and is solely determined by the Nb target properties. Therein, $N_{\rm{A}}=6.022\times10^{23}$~mol$^{-1}$ is the Avogadro constant, $\rho=8.57$~g/cm$^3$ stands for the mass density and $A=93$~g/mol for the atomic mass of niobium, and $L=1$~$\mu$m represents the target thickness. Numerically this evaluates to $5.5\times10^{18}$ Nb atoms/cm$^2$.

The cross section $\sigma$ of the isomer production strongly depends on the energy of the incoming protons as seen from Fig.~\ref{fig:isomer.cs}. According to \cite{Levkovskij,Singh2006,AvilaRodriguez2008,Ditroi2009} $\sigma$ is maximized in the energy region from 10 to 15 MeV, with values between 10 and 30 mb. In the following we consider for exemplification a proton beam of 12 MeV energy. 
Since the energy loss of  12~MeV protons is only about 18~keV per 1~$\mu$m Nb foil, several target foils could be manufactured at once. By taking a stack of 100 foils the 12~MeV protons slow down by merely 2~MeV \footnote{The energy loss in the Nb foils was calculated using the ATIMA code \cite{ATIMA}}.  Thus, essentially the whole energy range where the isomer production is most efficient would be covered by such a proton beam, guaranteeing  cross section values between 10 and 30~mb. Additionally, at 12~MeV proton energy a minimal beam flux of $10^{13}$~protons/s can be assumed \footnote{Cyclotron-based facilities with proton beam intensities higher than 100 $\mu$A are commercially available, see e.g. \cite{cyclone}} which leads together with a transmission efficiency $\epsilon=1$ and a cross section $\sigma=30$~mb to an isomer production rate of $I[{}^{93\mathrm{m}}\mathrm{Mo}]=1.7\times10^{6}$~s$^{-1}$. As a technical remark we note that in this procedure the Nb foils need to be cooled, since the total energy deposition of the proton beam is relatively high during the whole irradiation time. Moreover, manufacturing and handling of more than 100 foils is practically unrealistic.

By taking the exponential decay of the isomeric state into account, the number of produced isomers per foil after an irradiation time $t$ can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
N[{}^{93\mathrm{m}}\mathrm{Mo}]\left(t\right) = \frac{I[{}^{93\mathrm{m}}\mathrm{Mo}]}{\lambda} \left( 1 - e^{-\lambda t} \right),
\label{eq:number}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda = \ln 2 / T_{1/2}$ denotes the exponential decay constant. The ${}^{93\mathrm{m}}$Mo half life is given by $T_{1/2}=6.85$~h \cite{ENSDF}. For instance, after an irradiation time of $t=5\times T_{1/2}$ the number of isomers in the sample foil adds up to $5.6\times10^{10}$ for  $\sigma=30$~mb. In Table \ref{table:iso} values for $N[{}^{93\mathrm{m}}\mathrm{Mo}]$ for different times $t$ can be found considering reaction cross sections of either 10 or 30~mb.

The number of produced isomers given by Eq.~(\ref{eq:number}) is spatially distributed over the spot size of the impinging proton beam which is typically in the order of 1~mm$^2$ for the considered beam intensity. Since the XFEL can be focused much better, for instance on a spot of 10~$\mu$m$^2$ as it was assumed in the present work, the isomer density can safely be assumed to be homogeneous in this area. Considering the foil thickness of 1~$\mu$m, one obtains after an irradtion time of $t=5\times T_{1/2}$ an isomer density of
\begin{equation}
n[{}^{93\mathrm{m}}\mathrm{Mo}] = \frac{5.5\times10^{10}}{10^{-2}{\rm ~cm}^2\cdot 10^{-4}{\rm ~cm}}=5.5\times10^{16}{\rm ~cm^{-3}}.
\end{equation}
In our calculations we use the more conservative value of $1\times10^{16}$~cm$^{-3}$ produced isomers.
