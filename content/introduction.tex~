To say it with the words of Martin Luther King Jr.~: ``Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that.'' \cite{MartinLuther}

It was also the invention of the laser in 1960 \cite{Maiman1960-laser, Schawlow1958-laser} engaging a key role in the development of modern quantum dynamics which had a big stake in revolutionizing our view on nature. Many quantum phenomena could be investigated and understood by exploiting the laser's monochromaticity, directionality and coherence. The establishment of quantum optics led furthermore to many schemes for coherently controlling atomic degrees of freedom with light, and vice versa \cite{ScullyZubairy, Agarwal, Meystre}. The control of light and matter resulted in a vast amount of applications nowadays present in everyday life.

In quantum optics, mostly photons in the microwave, infrared or optical regime are used. Extending the ideas of quantum optical control to shorter wavelengths, e.g., to x-ray energies \cite{Adams2013.JoMO} brings new, basically different aspects into the field. 
X-rays, for instance, overcome the diffraction limit of optical photons potentially resolving spectral information with a high spatial accuracy \cite{Sayre1995, Tamasaku2011.NP}. 
Because of to the short wavelengths, x-rays can be much better focused than visible light potentially down to the sub-\AA~regime. Recent experiments have already demonstrated a focal spot diameter of several nm \cite{Mimura2010.NP, Huang2013.SR, Shapiro2014.NP} which renders physical research on the nanoscale feasible. In the future, it may be even possible to address single atoms by x-rays opening interesting perspectives for quantum information and quantum communication. 
In contrast to visible light, keV photons primarily interact with inner-shell electrons instead of the valence shell. In this manner, exotic systems, e.g., atoms with inner-shell vacancies can be prepared and studied under unique conditions. Moreover, x-rays are typically able to penetrate deep into materials leading to a uniform irradiation not only restricted to the surface. 

The main reason why x-ray wavelengths have been neglected in the quantum optical domain for a long time is the lack of a proper coherent x-ray source \cite{Baldwin1997.R}. However, already the commissioning of the third generation synchrotron light sources has boosted the development in many fields of physics concerned with x-rays including light-nucleus interaction experiments \cite{Bilderback2005-review-SR}.
%\cite{} have boosted the development in light-nucleus interaction experiments a lot. 
In comparison to former x-ray sources, synchrotrons are able to produce x-ray beams with much higher intensities and much better collimation properties. The new fourth generation light sources like x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) offer an even better beam quality characterized by partially coherent pulses with an eight orders of magnitude higher brilliance in comparison to synchrotron radiation (SR) \cite{Mcneil2010-XFEL}. Currently there are two XFELs operating in the hard x-ray regime \cite{Emma2010.NP, Ishikawa2012.NP} and several under construction \cite{EurXFEL-tdr, SwissFEL-tdr, MaRIE-web}. The application of seeding schemes \cite{Feldhaus1997.OC, Saldin2001.NIaMiPRA, DESY-seeding} or the construction of an x-ray oscillator \cite{Kim2008.PRL, Lindberg2011-XFELO} based on high-reflectivity x-ray mirrors \cite{Shvydko-book, Shvydko2011.NP} are expected to bring us closer to the long-time goal of fully coherent x-ray pulses. The concept of self-seeded free-electron lasers could be recently demonstrated in the soft \cite{Ratner2015.PRL} and hard x-ray regime \cite{Amann2012.self-seeded-XFEL}. The realization of two-color double-pulse XFELs  \cite{Hara2013.NC, Marinelli2015.NC} further improves the flexibility of x-ray light sources. These new x-ray lasers along with x-ray detection efficiencies close to 100\% render x-ray quantum optics a rich, promising and timely research field \cite{Adams2013.JoMO}.

Although the transfer of quantum optical schemes to x-ray wavelengths seems at first glance to be straightforward, the situation one encounters in reality often calls for new ideas. The drawbacks which require complementary approaches are, for instance, the poor temporal coherence of current x-ray sources \cite{Pfeifer2010.OL}, the existence of only a single beam line with a single x-ray photon energy in typical experimental setups and the compression of the photons into short pulses instead of continuous waves. 
A peculiar circumstance is that x-rays are no longer resonant to valence-electron transitions in atoms. 
The corresponding resonant systems are either inner-shell electron transitions in highly charged ions \cite{Beiersdorfer1998.PRL, Bernitt2012.N, Stefano2012.PRA, Stefano2013.PRA, Stefano2014.NP, Liu2014.NJP}, or alternatively transitions in atomic nuclei \cite{Buervenich2006, Adriana2008.JoMO}.

Nuclear transitions present a clean, well-isolated system with long coherence times. In comparison to highly charged ions, nuclei are in many aspects beneficial.
%superior
First of all, the interaction with nuclear transitions is reversible in the considered energy range, whereas in the interaction with electrons inside ions x-rays may ionize inner-shell electrons changing the system. Moreover, atomic nuclei can be embedded into high-density, solid-state targets. No external trapping mechanisms are required like it is the case for highly charged ions. Due to the placement inside solids, atomic nuclei are much less sensitive to small distortions of their environment than trapped ions whose state may crucially depend on collisions with surrounding particles. Instead, nuclear transitions can be addressed almost decoherence-free \cite{heeg2013vacuum}. The limitation coming from the small cross sections of the light-nucleus interaction \cite{Matinyan1998.PR} can be overcome by using high-density targets. 

%[Theory works ???]

Driving nuclear transitions in a controlled manner involves also practical purposes like the process of isomer triggering or isomer depletion \cite{Walker1999.N, Aprahamian2005.NP, Collins1999.PRL, Carroll2004.L, Adriana2007.PRL}. Isomers are long-lived nuclear excited states capable of storing the excitation energy over a long time. This entails potential applications, e.g., nuclear batteries. The basic idea of isomer triggering is to retrieve the energy initially stored in a metastable isomeric state via the excitation to an above-lying triggering level which is connected to freely radiating states. Belic and co-workers were able to demonstrate the triggering of the ${}^{180\rm{m}}$Ta isomer \cite{Belic1999.PRL, Belic2002.PRC} which has a lifetime of approx.~$10^{15}$ years, longer than the expected lifetime of the universe. They used 6~MeV bremsstrahlung photons to couple the isomeric state to a bunch of triggering levels. The efficiency of the incoherent coupling is however rather low. For triggering transitions in the keV range, the usage of coherent XFEL pulses instead of incoherent electromagnetic waves promises a strong increase in the depletion efficiency. 

Apart from the burst in isomer triggering applications, the XFEL is further expected to strongly promote the establishment of quantum optical schemes in the x-ray domain. The unique radiation properties of the XFEL offer for the first time the possibility to study the light-nucleus interaction beyond the weak nuclear excitation regime where more than one nucleus is excited per pulse \cite{Chumakov-talk}. 
The hopes are to observe nonlinear effects like Rabi oscillations \cite{Buervenich2006}, to gain the direct quantum control of nuclear excitations \cite{Rabitz2011.PRA} or to coherently manipulate nuclear state populations with x-ray pulses \cite{Wente2011.STIRAP, Wente2013.PRC}. 
The question is what qualitative and quantitative changes can be expected for nuclear quantum optics experiments to be performed at XFEL sources in the near future?

While in SR experiments the electronic response only acted as background, the XFEL intensity can reach values where the electronic interaction may additionally influence nuclear excitation channels. The increase of the electric field strength leads to drastic changes not only in the nuclear interaction, but also in the interaction between photons and electrons \cite{Hau-Riege.book}. For photon energies of approximatively 10~keV and middle-range atomic number $Z$ materials, the photoelectric effect dominates the electronic processes. The unique interplay between the super-intense XFEL and matter stimulated many applications and beautiful experiments in a broad spectrum of research fields. To be mentioned here are 
imaging in structural biology \cite{Neutze2000.N, Seibert2011.N, Kimura2014imaging}, 
nanochrystallography \cite{Chapman2011.N, Barty2012}, 
time-resolved observation of bond formation in solution \cite{Kim2015direct}, 
x-ray spectroscopy and diffraction of the photosystem II crucial for photosynthesis \cite{Kern2013, Kupitz2014, Suga2014}, 
double-core-hole creation \cite{Berrah2011, Tamasaku2013.PRL}, 
nonlinear x-ray two-photon absorption \cite{Tamasaku2014.NP}, 
x-ray and optical wave mixing \cite{Glover2012.N}, 
controlling x-rays with light \cite{Glover2010.NP}, 
stimulated x-ray emission \cite{Beye2013.N} 
and atomic inner-shell x-ray lasing \cite{Rohringer2012, Yoneda2015-lasing}. 

The light-matter interaction with the super-intense XFEL is of nonlinear nature since multiple x-ray photons are absorbed \cite{Rohringer2007.PRA}. There is a variety of works studying the behavior of matter, in particular due to photoionization, under these extreme conditions \cite{Nagler2009.NP, Young2010.N, Ciricosta2011.HEDP, Rudek2012.NP, Vinko2012.N, Chiricosta2012.PRL}. In experiments with neon \cite{Young2010.N, Ciricosta2011.HEDP} and xenon gases \cite{Rudek2012.NP, Son2012.PRA}, for instance, researchers could follow and analyze the formation of highly charged ions during a single XFEL pulse. Nagler and co-workers have moreover shown that solid-state aluminum targets turn transparent for soft x-rays during the photoionization by the intense photon beam \cite{Nagler2009.NP}. If the XFEL intensity is high enough even new states of matter like cold, high-density plasmas can be produced \cite{Lee2003.JOSAB}. In 2012, the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) beam has been applied with an intensity of around $10^{17}$~W/cm$^2$ to solid-state aluminum foils. Vinko and co-workers were able to create a solid-density plasma at temperatures in excess of $10^6$ K induced by the XFEL \cite{Vinko2012.N}.

In such plasma environments, secondary nuclear processes from the coupling to the atomic shell are rendered possible by the presence of free electrons and atomic vacancies. For instance, in the process of nuclear excitation by electron capture (NEEC) a free electron is captured into a bound state simultaneously transferring the capture energy to the atomic nucleus \cite{Adriana2006.PRA}. Such processes at the interface between atomic and nuclear physics may give insights into nuclear structure difficult to obtain in conventional scattering experiments and give direct information about nuclear transition energies and reduced transition probabilities. Moreover, secondary nuclear processes in the XFEL-induced plasma open new channels of nuclear excitation which could be neglected in SR experiments so far, but may be essential in nuclear photoexcitation studies with the XFEL. Depending on the goal of the nuclear quantum optics experiment, the plasma-mediated excitation channels might be of advantage, for instance if the maximization of nuclear excitation is desired, or of disadvantage, if  coherence-based enhancement of nonlinear interaction between x-rays and nuclei is envisaged.

So far the investigation of NEEC as nuclear excitation mechanism in plasma environments has been confined to hot astrophysical plasmas \cite{Gosselin2004.PRC, Morel2004.PRA, Gosselin2007.PRC, Morel2010.PRC, Stephan2014.PRC} or plasmas generated by optical lasers \cite{Harston1999.PRC}. In these studies no equivalent of the direct photoexcitation exists. For the first time, the potential competition of the \textbf{Direct and secondary nuclear excitation with the XFEL} is discussed in Part \ref{part:excitation} of this Thesis. Note that this is also a new and diametrically opposed situation compared to photonuclear studies involving petawatt optical lasers \cite{KenL2000.PRL, Cowan2000.PRL, Gibbon2005.Book, Spohr2008.NJP, Mourou2011.S}.

We investigate the secondary effect of NEEC at two explicit case studies: (i) the depletion of the ${}^{93\rm{m}}$Mo isomer via a 4.85~keV triggering transition to an above-lying level; and (ii) the resonant driving of the famous 14.4~keV M\"{o}ssbauer transition in ${}^{57}$Fe important for a large class of experiments. For both cases it is vital to know whether also additional plasma effects may play an important role for the nuclear excitation or for the sought-for coherence effects. In order to take time-dependent dynamics of the plasma into account the plasma expansion is parameterized by means of a hydrodynamical model \cite{KrainovS2002, DitmireDRFP1996} in the quasi-neutral limit. Atomic processes in the plasma are included with the help of the population kinetics model implemented in the FLYCHK code \cite{FLYCHK}. Following a fair comparison between direct photoexcitation via the XFEL and secondary NEEC in the occurring plasma, our results show that for the case of isomer triggering in ${}^{93}$Mo secondary nuclear excitation via NEEC dominates by several orders of magnitude. This is not at all the case for $^{57}\mathrm{Fe}$, where the secondary excitation can be safely neglected. Based on our findings, we work out criteria related to the nuclear transition energy, the atomic structure and plasma conditions that can be used to identify whether for a particular nuclear species, the secondary processes can be dominant compared to the direct photoexcitation channel. This knowledge is then applied to the present nuclear transition candidates starting from stable or metastable ground states and energies in the operation range of the XFEL. These results are most relevant for the layout of future nuclear quantum optics experiments at the XFEL.

Having investigated the control over nuclear transitions by means of x-ray lasers, it is natural to ask whether nuclear transitions can be in turn used to coherently manipulate x-rays. The capabilities to store and release single x-rays on demand \cite{Shvydko1996.PRL, Helisto1991.PRL, Olga2011.PRA}, to manipulate the group velocity of $\gamma$-ray bursts \cite{Shakhmuratov2009.PRA}, to control the M\"{o}ssbauer spectra in a coherent way and to modify the time behavior of x-ray photons \cite{Vagizov2014} have already been proven with nuclear iron samples.
The ${}^{57}$Fe nucleus is one among few nuclear species which may absorb and emit radiation recoil-free inside solid-state samples. This process has been first demonstrated by R.~M\"{o}ssbauer in 1958 \cite{Mossbauer1, Mossbauer2} and is known today as the M\"{o}ssbauer effect.
Depending on the sample properties, the 14.4~keV M\"{o}ssbauer transition in ${}^{57}$Fe can be strongly enhanced via cooperative effects \cite{NFS-bible, Roehlsberger2004} and has been intensively investigated. Along with the developed instrumentation and optical elements for 14.4~keV photons, the distinct properties of ${}^{57}$Fe seem to make it the perfect candidate for nuclear quantum optics experiments.
The ${}^{57}$Fe nucleus is furthermore the present candidate for x-ray quantum optics using nuclear transitions in thin film x-ray planar cavities \cite{Roehlsberger2004, heeg2013x}. Within this geometry, effects like the collective Lamb shift \cite{Rohlsberger2010.S}, electromagnetically induced transparency \cite{Rohlsberger2012.N}, spontaneously generated coherences \cite{heeg2013vacuum}, subluminal light propagation \cite{Slowlight2015} and Fano resonance control \cite{Fano2015} could be demonstrated at x-ray energies.

%This effect together with the typically very narrow nuclear transition widths makes atomic nuclei to perfect candidates for precision spectroscopy.
%\cite{Pound1959.PRL, Klingelhofer2004}

%Along with the developed instrumentation and optical elements for 14.4~keV photons, ${}^{57}$Fe has been used be used as resonant system for demonstrating quantum optical schemes in the nuclear realm.

%Examples of successful demonstration are, for instance, the storage of single photons by dynamically controlling the nuclear response \cite{Shvydko1996.PRL}, the observation of $\gamma$-echoes via phase shifts \cite{Helisto1991.PRL, Olga2011.PRA}, the control of the $\gamma$-ray absorption via nuclear level anticrossing \cite{Coussement2002.PRL}, the coherent optical control of M\"{o}ssbauer spectra \cite{Kocharovskaya1999} and the coherent manipulation of waveforms of single $\gamma$-rays by applying nuclear target vibrations \cite{Vagizov2014}. 


%Due to the low degeneracy of SR, nuclear experiments performed at synchrotron sources are operated in the linear regime, where at most one nucleus is excited per pulse \cite{Roehlsberger2004}. Many of the present studies using M\"{o}ssbauer solid-state targets at synchrotron facilities have, however extensions envisaged with the XFEL as source of stronger, nonlinear nuclear excitation. The hopes are to observe nonlinear effects like Rabi oscillations \cite{Buervenich2006}, to gain the direct quantum control of nuclear excitations \cite{Rabitz2011.PRA} or to coherently manipulate nuclear state populations with x-ray pulses \cite{Wente2011.STIRAP, Wente2013.PRC}.

Experiments performed with M\"{o}ssbauer targets at SR facilities significantly boosted the studies of the resonant light-nucleus interaction, although these investigations are limited to the linear regime where at most one nucleus is excited per pulse \cite{Roehlsberger2004}.
In particular the pioneering work of Shvyd'ko \cite{Shvydko1996.PRL}, where the storage of single photons by dynamically controlling the nuclear response has been achieved, inspired several works proposing control schemes in nuclear forward scattering setups. Worth mentioning are, for instance, the nuclear ``cage'' for x-rays \cite{Wente2012-storage}
%, all-electromagnetically controlled gradient photon echoes \cite{Wente2014-GPE} 
and the field control of single x-ray photons \cite{Xiangjin2014}. Single photon entanglement in the x-ray regime \cite{Adriana2009.PRL, Wente2014-entanglement} and the entanglement between macroscopic nuclear samples \cite{Wente2014.arxiv} have also been discussed on the basis of nuclear forward scattering. These control procedures operated at single-photon nuclear interfaces along with the recent development of x-ray optics elements \cite{Shvydko2003.PRL, Chang2005.PRL, Chen2008.APL, Shvydko2010.NP, Shvydko2011.NP, Osaka2013.OE, Shvydko-book} and x-ray waveguides \cite{Pfeiffer2002-waveguide, Jarre2005-waveguide, Salditt2008-waveguide, Okamoto2012-waveguide, Kruger2012-waveguide} open the perspective to extend fields like quantum information and quantum communication to photon energies in the keV range.

The elementary building block of all quantum information protocols is the information carrier, the so-called qubit \cite{NielsenChuang2000}. So far, mostly microwaves or optical photons are used as information carriers. X-ray photonic qubits potentially have sub-\AA~spatial resolution \cite{Doring2013.OE}, drastically reducing the fundamental limitation on nanoscale photonic circuits. A promising way to encode information in single x-rays is to employ orthogonal polarization states like it is accomplished in the optical regime \cite{Kok2007.RMP, Kocsis2013.NP, Crespi2011.NC, OBrien2003.N}. X-ray linear polarization can be  measured with  precision up to $0.3^{\circ}$ using polarimeters based on the Compton effect \cite{Tashenov2011.PRL, Tashenov2013.PRA}, and Bragg reflections on crystals can filter polarizations states as good as $10^{-6}\%$ \cite{Toellner1995.polarizer,Marx2011.polarizer}. However, such information encoding requires precise control and processing schemes for the polarization of individual x-rays so far not addressed.

In Part \ref{part:x-ray-control} of this Thesis the possibility to implement \textbf{Logic gates with polarization-encoded single x-rays} by means of resonant nuclear interactions is therefore investigated. A broadband x-ray pulse resonant to a nuclear transition impinges on a target in the presence of a hyperfine magnetic field and produces a single nuclear excitation. Fast rotations of the hyperfine field \cite{Shvydko1996.PRL} are used to actively manipulate the polarization of the single-photon response of the nuclear target. We show that it is feasible to implement single-input logical gates via such magnetic field rotations, and even binary gates by introducing in addition a second, temporally synchronized control photon. Possible x-ray photonic realizations of logical operations involving two input states like the destructive controlled NOT (CNOT) gate are put forward.

Polarization-encoding can be also used to mark individual interference paths in order to obtain the \textit{which-way} information, e.g., in the course of a scattering process.
%The manipulation of the nuclear polarization response relies on the interference between the hyperfine transitions controllable by the moment of magnetic field rotation. 
In general, interference occurs whenever a system has the possibility to choose between different interaction paths to reach the same final state. The most famous interference setup is probably Young's double slit where the indistinguishability of two spatial paths leads to an interference pattern in the momentum distribution. Quantum interference is closely related to the principle of complementarity \cite{Bohr1928}, referring to the inability of revealing all information about a quantum system within a single experimental setup.

In quantum systems it is, for instance, possible to coherently obtain the \textit{which-way} information in a double-slit setup which can be erased again later on, recovering the interference ability. This scheme proposed in Ref.~\cite{eraser1982} is known as the ``quantum eraser''. 
The basic elements of a quantum eraser, so enumerated in Ref.~\cite{Zeilinger1995} are individual interfering quantum systems, a method of introducing which-path information, and a method of subsequently erasing this information in order to restore the interference. Various realizations of the quantum eraser in more or less traditional systems have been reported so far. First experiments in this direction employed entangled optical photon pairs for the study of interference \cite{Zeilinger1995} and momentum-position complementarity \cite{Ou1990,Zajonc1991,Kwiat1992}, while later on also more exotic systems have been employed or envisaged, for instance, mesoscopic systems \cite{Hans1998,mesoScience2014}, kaons \cite{kaons2004}, nuclear spins \cite{nmr2001}, continuous-variable quantum erasing using field quadrature amplitude and phases \cite{Leuchs2004} or ultrafast quantum emitters in microcavities \cite{Savasta2011}. We note that most of these setups address the position-momentum complementarity, with  few exceptions \cite{Zeilinger1995,kaons2004,Leuchs2004}. 

%Due to the inseparability between the quantum system and the classical detector, some observables become mutually exclusive, i.e., they are complementary. The precise knowledge of one of them implies that all possible outcomes of measuring the other observable are equally probable. Although originally examples of complementarity referred mostly to the position (particle-like) and momentum (wave-like) attributes of a quantum system, one can also connect for instance energy and time, or different spin projections. 

%Complementarity is closely related to Heisenberg's uncertainty relations \cite{Heisenberg1927}  that describe the limitations on the possible accuracy of classical measurements of a quantum system. Over the years, the dilemmas of complementarity gedankenexperiments such as Einstein's recoiling-slit two-slit experiment \cite{BohrEinstein} or Feynman's electron-light scattering scheme \cite{Feynman} were solved invoking the position-momentum uncertainty relation \cite{Heisenberg1927}, prompting the question whether complementarity is always enforced by the uncertainty relations. A vivid theoretical debate \cite{Scully1991.N,Storey1994.N,replyScully,replyStorey,commentWiseman} as well as several experiments \cite{Eichmann1993,Duerr1998,Mir2007} showed that complementarity is more fundamental than the uncertainty relation, i.e., one can find cases in which the effect of Heisenberg's uncertainty relations is not sufficient to justify the occurring complementarity.

%Quantum optical systems have turned out to be the perfect playground for investigating and modeling quantum interference effects, the key concept in complementarity (gedanken)experiments \cite{BohrEinstein, Feynman}. 


As a further application of the single-photon polarization control in Part \ref{part:x-ray-control}, we propose a \textbf{Quantum eraser with x-ray quanta}, extending time-energy complementarity tests into a so far unexplored parameter range, the domain of x-ray photons. Considering the setup of nuclear forward scattering with synchrotron radiation, typically more than one hyperfine transition can be driven at once. The interference between the different frequency components results in the characteristic quantum beat pattern. The idea is to mark these scattering paths with orthogonal polarizations, e.g., right- and left-circular, in order to gain the \textit{which-way} information. Once we know the scattering channel of the x-ray photon, the quantum beat pattern disappears in the intensity spectrum. However, projecting on a linear polarization basis recovers the quantum interference by erasing the \textit{which-way} information. We put forward two schemes how to realize such a quantum eraser setup with x-ray quanta.



\subsection*{Structure of the Thesis}

This Thesis is organized into two parts. Part \ref{part:excitation} is about \textbf{Nuclear excitations induced by high-intensity x-ray lasers}. It starts with an introduction to the physics of x-ray free-electron lasers where the basic working principle is explained. The main goal of Chapter \ref{chap:XFEL} is however to work out the prospects for nuclear physics opened by the XFEL. Afterwards in Chapter \ref{chap:bloch}, the fundamental theory of the light-nucleus interaction is discussed. We follow a semiclassical approach where the nucleus is described as two-level system and the radiation field classically. Chapter \ref{chap:NEEC} is devoted to the theoretical treatment of nuclear excitation by electron capture. The microscopic description builds the basis for treating NEEC as secondary excitation channel in an XFEL-induced plasma. Chapter \ref{chap:direct-secondary} closes then the first Part. It delivers our numerical results for the competition between direct and secondary nuclear processes in nuclear photoexcitation setups with the XFEL. Here, the theoretical model for the plasma expansion is derived as well.

Part \ref{part:x-ray-control} of this Thesis treats the topic of \textbf{Single x-rays controlled by nuclear transitions}. In Chapter \ref{chap:NFS}, we give a comprehensive description of nuclear forward scattering. We employ a theoretical approach which solves the problem directly in space and time. In Chapter \ref{chap:pol-control}, the possibility to dynamically manipulate the polarization response of nuclear targets by applying timed rotations of a magnetic field is discussed. Furthermore, it is shown how to extend present control schemes beyond the single scattering approximation. Our results for the implementation of logical operations for polarization-encoded x-rays is topic of Chapter \ref{chap:logical-gates}. In Chapter \ref{chap:quantum-eraser}, we propose a quantum eraser scheme employing nuclear forward scattering which enables time-energy complementarity tests in so-far unexplored parameter regimes.

Finally, the main findings are summarized and an outlook for future investigations is given.
