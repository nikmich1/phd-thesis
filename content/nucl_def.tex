\label{ch:nucl_def}


\begin{itemize}
\item Introduce g factor in Furry picture for arbitrary nuclear potentials
\item Introduce nuclear averaged potential for spinless nuclei
\item Introduce nuclear shape effect
\item Introduce previoulsy used effective radius method
\item Introduce new numerical method 
\item Show results for evaluation across nuclear chart
\item Show and discuss difference to effective radius method
\end{itemize}
