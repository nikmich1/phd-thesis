\chapter{Bound state QED in the Furry picture}
\label{ch:furry_pic}

\begin{itemize}
\item Division of electromagnetic 4-potential in background and quantum part
\item Bound states as poles in correlation functions
\item Inclusion of background part in wave functions
\item Quantum fluctuations around background as perturbation theory
\item Treatment of perturbations in Furry picture(mixed QED+HFS)
\item Treatment of nuclear structure effects in Furry picture (nuclear excited states)\cite{Michel2018}
\end{itemize}
