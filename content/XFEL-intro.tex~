\label{chap:XFEL}


Optical lasers have engaged a key role in the investigation of quantum dynamics in atomic systems over the last decades. While their success story is in particular based on non-linear effects, quantum phenomena and coherence, these are still difficult to achieve in the x-ray energy domain. In contrast to optical photons, x-rays are not longer resonant to valence-electron transitions, but rather inner-shell electrons in highly charged ions or low-lying nuclear transitions in the keV regime can be addressed. In particular in the nuclear realm, the advent and commissioning of the x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) promise significant progress in nuclear quantum optical experiments with x-rays. This Chapter is therefore devoted to XFELs and their potential applications for nuclear physics. In Sec.~\ref{sec:xfel}, first the basic working principle of the XFEL is explained. Particular emphasis is put on the properties of the produced x-ray pulses which make them attractive for studying the resonant laser-nucleus interaction. Afterwards, in Sec.~\ref{sec:photoexcitation} we stress how the XFEL can be used to go beyond the weak nuclear excitation regime. Furthermore, the principle of isomer triggering is discussed. Sec.~\ref{sec:plasma-processes} is then devoted to possible plasma-mediated nuclear processes which occur under very characteristic plasma conditions due to the unique light-matter interaction of the XFEL.

\section{The x-ray free-electron laser}
\label{sec:xfel}

Crystals, liquid dye or gases are the most common gain media for conventional lasers. In the latter light amplification is realized via the stimulated emission of electronic transitions inside the gain medium. In order to turn stimulated emission dominant over resonant absorption, the number of atoms in the excited state needs to be larger than the number of atoms in the ground state. This kind of population inversion is reached via an external energy source, the so-called pump. Establishing the population inversion for the lasing transition transforms the gain medium into an optical amplifier. This amplification process is further enhanced by using a resonator which directs the photons many times through the gain medium before extraction. The output laser light is finally characterized by a high degree of coherence, a narrow (diffraction-limited) beam collimation and a single frequency typically in the optical, ultraviolet or infrared regime. 

%The wish to build a coherent x-ray source exists nearly since the invention of the optical laser in 1960 \cite{Maiman1960-laser, Schawlow1958-laser}. The crossover from visible to x-ray energies has mainly two fundamental obstacles: (i) the higher frequency $\omega$ of the lasing transition requires more pump energy in order to obtain population inversion inside the gain medium; (ii) according to Fermi's golden rule, the spontaneous emission rate is proportional to $\omega^3$ which leads to much shorter lifetimes of nuclear excited states in comparison to optical excitations in atoms. Hence, the high-energy pump would have to be compressed into a short pulse which can be quickly deposited in the gain medium. This requirement makes it nearly impossible to build an x-ray laser in the conventional sense, rather a new, radically different approach is necessary.

The wish to build a coherent x-ray source exists nearly since the invention of the optical laser in 1960 \cite{Maiman1960-laser, Schawlow1958-laser}. However, it has been quickly realized that the crossover from the visible to the x-ray domain has some fundamental obstacles resulting in the dilemma of the $\gamma$-ray laser based on nuclear transitions \cite{Baldwin1997.R}. On the one hand, a sufficient number of nuclei needs to be accumulated in order to obtain population inversion, on the other hand, the $\gamma$-ray emission must be operated at its natural line width to achieve the maximal possible stimulated emission rate. The antagonism is that the high pump intensity required for population inversion is either not achievable with available sources or leads to heating and destruction effects of the gain medium resulting in inhomogeneous broadening of the lasing transition \cite{Odeurs2010-gamma-laser, Brinke2013-gamma-laser}. Since the cross section of stimulated emission ($\propto \lambda^2$) is anyway strongly suppressed in the case of x-ray wavelengths (more than 8 orders of magnitude in comparison to optical photons) \cite{Odeurs2010-gamma-laser}, this dilemma makes it nearly impossible to build an x-ray laser in the conventional sense; rather a new, radically different approach is required.

In order to bypass this dilemma much effort has been put into the development of a coherent x-ray source which finally peaked out in the commissioning of the x-ray free-electron lasers. Instead of using bound transitions in crystals, liquid dye or gases, the gain medium of the XFEL is made up of free electrons. The basic idea relies on the fact that the acceleration of charged particles to relativistic velocities leads to a strong emission of electromagnetic waves. Unlike in conventional lasers, the amplification process of the XFEL happens only in a single pass through the gain medium.

The working principle of the XFEL is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:xfel}. Pre-accelerated electrons typically via a linear accelerator (LINAC) enter a long array of periodically arranged magnetic dipoles, the so-called undulator. Due to the Lorentz force of the periodic magnetic field, the electrons start to oscillate leading to the emission of electromagnetic waves. Since the electrons move with relativistic velocities close to the speed of light, the emitted radiation is strongly collimated into the forward direction \cite{Tesla-TDR-2001}. Moreover, the usage of free electrons as gain medium has the advantage that the photon energy is not restricted to a certain atomic transition. This makes the radiation typically tunable over a wide wavelength spectrum depending on the properties of the incoming electron beam \cite{Tesla-TDR-2001}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{pics/XFEL-2.pdf}
\caption{Working principle of the XFEL. After entering the undulator the pre-accelerated electrons start to oscillate and emit radiation into the forward direction. By passing the undulator, the electron beam becomes longitudinally modulated, a phenomenon called micro-bunching. The modulation leads to a collective emission which is exponentially amplified along the undulator passage.}
\label{fig:xfel}
\end{figure}

A key feature of the XFEL mechanism is the micro-bunching \cite{Mcneil2010-XFEL} of the electron cloud as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:xfel}. During the propagation through the undulator the electron beam experiences a longitudinal modulation caused by the interaction with the self-emitted electromagnetic waves. The transverse B-field of these waves and the transverse velocity component of the electrons results in a Lorentz force which pushes the electron beam into micro-bunches. This modulation has two important consequences \cite{Margaritondo2011.xfel, Tesla-TDR-2001}: (i) the total emitted intensity is proportional to $N^2$ instead of $N$ where $N$ is the number of electrons; (ii) the radiation power is exponentially amplified along the passage through the undulator, a process called self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE). Moreover, the wavelength of the emitted radiation pulse is directly connected to the periodicity of the micro-bunching \cite{Margaritondo2011.xfel}. In contrast to common optical lasers, XFELs are operated in a single-SASE setup where the x-ray pulse traverses only once the undulator. 

Characteristic for this new kind of radiation sources are the small wavelengths in the x-ray regime, high power, high brilliance, narrow bandwidths ($\sim$~eV), pure polarization and good coherence properties. The pulse duration lies usually in the range of hundreds of fs. The brilliance is determined by the spectral photon flux divided by the divergence and the rms radius of the photon beam. 
%It gives a measure how many photons per time are emitted into ... \textcolor{red}{????}. 
In comparison to synchrotron radiation (SR) sources, XFEL facilities are able to provide x-ray pulses with an eight orders of magnitude higher brilliance \cite{Mcneil2010-XFEL}.
%However, due to random fluctuations of the initial electron distribution, spectral properties and intensity can vary from shot to shot.
%In general, the quality of the x-ray pulse is critically dependent on the quality of the incoming electron beam.

In addition to the brightness of the XFEL radiation, the coherence properties are substantially improved in comparison to broad-band synchrotron radiation. However, while the XFEL pulses are fully spatial coherent, their temporal coherence is poor because of random fluctuations in the electron charge density at the start-up of the SASE process \cite{Pfeifer2010.OL}. In general, the quality of the x-ray pulse is critically dependent on the quality of the incoming electron beam. Since the electrons are typically produced by the emission of a cathode, the random distribution at the start-up leads to XFEL wave packets consisting of many statistically distributed spikes. Each individual radiation spike is fully coherent, spatially as well as temporally, but without fixed phase relation among each other. 
%The spike-like structure of each x-ray pulse changes randomly from shot to shot

Until now, there are mainly two ideas on how to tackle the problem of the poor temporal coherence. The first idea is to load the undulator with an already seeded light pulse which can reduce shot-to-shot fluctuations at the start-up (seeded XFEL) \cite{Feldhaus1997.OC,Saldin2001.NIaMiPRA,DESY-seeding}. The two-stage SASE free-electron laser proposed by Feldhaus in 1997 \cite{Feldhaus1997.OC} has already been demonstrated in the soft \cite{Ratner2015.PRL} and hard x-ray regime \cite{Amann2012.self-seeded-XFEL}. The design consists of a sequence of two undulators with a monochromator in between. Operating the first undulator in the linear regime results in a seeded radiation pulse at the entrance of the second undulator. A monochromatic x-ray pulse close to the Fourier limit and a significant reduction of shot-to-shot fluctuations in the energy spectral density can be expected.

The second idea to improve the temporal coherence of the XFEL radiation is to construct an x-ray oscillator (XFEL oscillator, XFELO) \cite{Kim2008.PRL}. Key ingredients for the XFELO are electron bunches of ultralow emittance and a low-loss optical cavity. The cavity directs the light pulse several times through the undulator such that it meets a new, fresh electron bunch each time when entering the undulator. In this manner, the initially incoherent x-rays evolve into a coherent pulse. In order to obtain an exponential increase of the pulse intensity along with the round-trip number, a low-loss x-ray cavity based on high-reflectivity crystals \cite{Shvydko-book} is required. For instance, a 0.2~mm thick sapphire crystal shows a reflectivity of 0.96 for 14.4 keV photons while keeping the heat load minimal \cite{Kim2008.PRL}. Diamond mirrors with a reflectivity at normal incidence close to 100\% are even more preferable \cite{Shvydko2011.NP}. Apart of the good coherence properties, the XFELO output radiation is anticipated to comprise a narrow spectral bandwidth (more than 3 orders of magnitude narrower in comparison to the XFEL) and a high repetition rate. Although a lower peak intensity is expected in comparison to the XFEL, the peak brilliance should be of the same order of magnitude while the average spectral brightness should increase by a factor of one thousand in the case of the XFELO \cite{Lindberg2011-XFELO}.

Currently, there are two operating XFEL facilities worldwide, the LCLS \cite{LCLS-web} at SLAC in Stanford and the SACLA \cite{SACLA-web} in Japan. The LCLS provides photons with an energy of approximatively 10~keV and an average spectral brightness up to $2.7\times10^{22}$ photons/(s mrad$^2$ mm$^2$ 0.1\%bandwidth). The SACLA facility in Japan delivered the so-far highest  photon energy of 19.5~keV. In addition, several XFEL machines are in construction like the European XFEL \cite{EurXFEL-tdr} at DESY in Hamburg, the SwissFEL \cite{SwissFEL-tdr} at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland, and MaRIE \cite{MaRIE-web} at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States. The European XFEL, for instance, is expected to achieve photon energies up to 24.8~keV \cite{EurXFEL-tdr}. The XFEL higher harmonics may even provide photon pulses with energies above 25~keV.

In Table \ref{table:laser}, we summarize the parameters of the currently running XFELs, the LCLS and the SACLA, and of the European XFEL which is still under construction at DESY. Additionally, we also provide expected characteristics for the XFELO. We assume a moderate laser focusing on a spot of 10~$\mu$m$^2$, although a focal length of 7~nm has for instance already been achieved in Ref. \cite{Mimura2010.NP}. While the peak intensities of the considered lasers are all on the order of $10^{17}$~W/cm$^2$, the XFELO has an outstanding long coherence time (1 ps) and also an expected repetition rate of $10^6$~Hz \cite{Kim2008.PRL} which is about 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than the other facilities. In Chap.~\ref{chap:direct-secondary}, we will explicitly show that the coherence properties and the repetition rate play a crucial role in the XFEL nuclear photoexcitation.

%Additionally, we also provide expected characteristics for the XFELO in order to point out the importance of temporal coherent radiation pulses in the direct laser-nucleus interaction later.

\section{Nuclear photoexcitation}
\label{sec:photoexcitation}

The advent and commissioning of the XFEL promise significant progress in the field of nuclear quantum optics. It offers in particular the possibility to investigate the direct laser-nucleus interaction in solid-state targets with coherent, highly brilliant x-ray pulses resonant to nuclear transitions in the few keV regime. In the optical domain there is a multitude of methods successfully applied to understand and manipulate the dynamical behavior of electronic states in atoms. The idea of nuclear quantum optics is to transfer these methods to the nuclear realm in order to explore and control the electromagnetic interaction of nuclei on the most fundamental level \cite{Buervenich2006}. 
%The resonant laser-nucleus interaction could, for instance, be used to measure nuclear properties like transition frequency or dipole moment independent of any nuclear model. 
The controlled preparation, manipulation and detection of nuclear states would, for instance, offer the possibility to measure nuclear properties like transition frequency or dipole moment independent of any nuclear model. 

%So far, experiments concerning the direct light-nucleus interaction are mostly done with either broadband SR light \cite{Gerdau1999.HI}
%, single-photon M\"{o}ssbauer sources \cite{} 
%or bremsstrahlung photons \cite{Kneissl1996}. The 14.4 keV M\"ossbauer transition in $^{57}\mathrm{Fe}$ is currently the ``working horse'' of the nuclear forward scattering community at synchrotron sources \cite{Shvydko1996.PRL,Roehlsberger2004} and it is also the present candidate for x-ray quantum optics using nuclear transitions in thin film x-ray planar cavities \cite{Roehlsberger2004, heeg2013x}. Phenomena like the collective Lamb shift \cite{Rohlsberger2010.S}, electromagnetically induced transparency \cite{Rohlsberger2012.N} and spontaneously generated coherences \cite{heeg2013vacuum} have already been measured in nuclear systems. Furthermore, advanced quantum optical schemes have been constructed using these thin film x-ray cavities which rendered it possible to control the group velocity of narrow-band x-rays \cite{Slowlight2015} and to manipulate Fano interferences from symmetric to strongly asymmetric line shapes \cite{Fano2015}.

A general hindrance in the laser-induced nuclear excitation is that only a small fraction of the laser photons really fulfills the nuclear resonance condition due to the usually small nuclear transition widths. This has two major consequences. First, since only a small number of nuclei is excited per pulse, the repetition rate of the XFEL facility is a key ingredient for an effective driving of nuclear transitions. The repetition rates of the LCLS and the SACLA have with 30~Hz and 10~Hz, respectively, the same order of magnitude (see Table~\ref{table:laser}). The future European XFEL is expected to provide light pulses with a repetition rate of $4\times10^4$~Hz and the XFELO even with a frequency of $10^6$~Hz, which is 3 and respectively 4-5 orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding values of the already operational XFELs. 

The second consequence is that we need to introduce an effective laser intensity which accounts for the mismatch between photon and nuclear transition energy \cite{Adriana2008.PRC}, namely
\begin{equation}
I_{\rm{eff}} = \frac{\Gamma_{\rm{nucl}}}{\Gamma_{\rm{laser}}} I\ .
\label{eq:eff.intensity}
\end{equation}
Thereby, $\Gamma_{\rm{nucl}}$ denotes the nuclear transition width and $\Gamma_{\rm{laser}}$ the bandwidth of the laser pulse. The effective field amplitude $E_{\rm{eff}}$ experienced by the corresponding nuclear transition is proportional to $\sqrt{I_{\rm{eff}}}$.

So far, experiments concerning the direct light-nucleus interaction are mostly performed with incoherent, broadband SR light \cite{Gerdau1999.HI}. In particular the interaction of x-ray light with M\"{o}ssbauer nuclei in the few keV transition energy range has gained considerable momentum, both theoretically \cite{Kocharovskaya1999, Adriana2009.PRL, Wente2012-storage, heeg2013x, Brinke2013-gamma-laser, Wente2014-entanglement, Xiangjin2014, Wente2014.arxiv, Adriana2010.JoMO, Adriana2011.PRB, Junker2012.NJP, Wente2012-Th, heeg2015y} and experimentally \cite{Shvydko1996.PRL, Helisto1991.PRL, Olga2011.PRA, Coussement2002.PRL, Roehlsberger2004, Rohlsberger2010.S, Rohlsberger2012.N, heeg2013vacuum, Vagizov2014, Slowlight2015, Fano2015}.
In all these experiments only weak nuclear excitations can be achieved due to the low degeneracy of SR and the small nuclear transition widths (typically $\sim 10^{-8}$~eV). The high brilliance of XFELs drastically changes this situation, making the step from one to a few or maybe many resonant photons per pulse. 
Recently, the first nuclear resonance scattering experiment at an XFEL has been performed with FeBO$_3$ crystals \cite{Chumakov-talk}. Chumakov and co-workers have demonstrated multiple nuclear excitations of ${}^{57}$Fe. Using a high-monochromatization scheme for the x-ray beam at SACLA, up to 70 excited nuclei per pulse could be achieved.

%In a recent experiment at the SACLA in Japan, the first nuclear resonance experiment at an XFEL, up to 70 nuclei per pulse could be excited at once in a FeBO$_3$ target enchriched with ${}^{57}$Fe \cite{Chumakov-talk}. 
%In this regime effects like Rabi oscillation may start to play a role \cite{Buervenich2006}. 

Apart of reaching the multiple excitation regime, the coherence properties of the self-seeded XFEL in development today \cite{Amann2012.self-seeded-XFEL} are expected to further promote quantum optical effects \cite{Adams2013.JoMO, Buervenich2006, Adriana2008.PRC} in the nuclear realm. For instance, when coherent population transfer in nuclear systems becomes feasible \cite{Wente2011.STIRAP, Wente2013.PRC}, nuclear reactions can be studied in systems initially prepared in excited states. The controlled excitation of nuclei entails further potential applications like fully coherent $\gamma$-ray lasers \cite{Baldwin1997.R, Kocharovskaya1999, Coussement2002.PRL}, a new nuclear frequency standard based on the isomeric state in ${}^{229}$Th \cite{Peik2003-Th-clock} or a nuclear energy storage solution founded on the principle of isomer triggering \cite{Walker1999.N, Aprahamian2005.NP, Collins1999.PRL, Carroll2004.L, Adriana2007.PRL}. 
%Here, we will have a closer look at the latter.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.6\linewidth]{pics/isomer-triggering-3.pdf}
\caption{The process of isomer triggering. The decay of the metastable isomeric state to the ground state is highly forbidden. The excitation to an above lying triggering level which is connected to the ground state can efficiently depopulate the isomer releasing the initially stored excitation energy.}
\label{fig:isomer-trig}
\end{figure}

Isomers are long-lived nuclear excited states whose decay to the ground state is fundamentally supressed (see Fig.~\ref{fig:isomer-trig}). In general, one needs to distinguish between shape, spin and K isomers \cite{Walker1999.N}. In shape isomers a metastable state occurs due to a second potential minimum for large elongation of the nucleus. Such isomers typically decay by fission into two smaller parts and only in a few cases the $\gamma$-decay channel is able to compete. In the case of spin and K isomers the decay to the ground state is highly forbidden because of angular momentum conservation. A large change in either the nuclear spin quantum number or the spin projection quantum number (K represents the spin projection onto the nuclear symmetry axis) requires the emission of photons with high multipolarity which is strongly suppressed.

The isomeric lifetimes can range from ms (${}^{242\rm{m}}$Am: $\tau \approx 14$~ms, shape isomer) over hours (${}^{180\rm{m}}$Hf: $\tau \approx 5.5$~h, K isomer) up to millions of years (${}^{180\rm{m}}$Ta: $\tau \approx 10^{15}$~y, spin isomer). The study of isomers has several incentives \cite{Aprahamian2005.NP}: (i) they are expected to play a crucial role in the creation of elements in the universe which is important for nuclear astrophysics; (ii) understanding the formation process of isomers would gain new insights into the nuclear structure; (iii) the process of isomer triggering makes them to a ``clean'' energy storage solution. 

The idea of isomer triggering is to connect the metastable isomer with an above lying triggering level in order to release the initially stored excitation energy on demand. The triggering level needs to be linked to freely radiating states in order to efficiently depopulate the isomer. The basic principle of isomer triggering is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:isomer-trig}. Triggering via the coherent XFEL radiation is expected to lead to a strong enhancement of the depletion efficiency in comparison to the incoherent excitation mechanisms so far employed \cite{Belic1999.PRL, Belic2002.PRC}.

In Chap.~\ref{chap:direct-secondary}, we investigate the XFEL-induced depletion of the isomeric state in molybdenum. The 6.85 h long-lived ${}^{93\rm{m}}$Mo isomer is particularly attractive for an XFEL-induced activation, since the isomeric energy of 2.5 MeV can be retrieved by a 4.85 keV triggering transition accessible by today's XFEL facilities. Because of the advantageous energy ratio, 4.85 keV to 2.5 MeV, isomer depletion in ${}^{93}$Mo opens interesting applications for energy storage solutions. Advantageous is furthermore that the long-lived excited state ${}^{93\rm{m}}$Mo can be produced by $^{93}_{41}$Nb(p,n)$^{93\mathrm{m}}_{\phantom{m} 42}$Mo reactions. In this way, the isomers are directly embedded into solid-state niobium foils which makes it possible to employ solid-state target scenarios beneficial for an XFEL activation. Surprisingly, it is not the direct photoexcitation which dominates the ${}^{93\rm{m}}$Mo isomer triggering in such a scenario, instead secondary processes from the coupling to the atomic shell play the crucial role. How such secondary excitation channels come into play is discussed in the next Section. 


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\section{Plasma-mediated nuclear processes}
\label{sec:plasma-processes}

The step from broadband synchrotron sources to coherent XFEL facilities is expected to bring nuclear photoexcitation experiments from the regime of weak excitation into a region where a few nuclei can be excited at once, as motivated in the previous Section. In the same manner the high XFEL intensity enhances the light-nucleus interaction, also the interaction with the electrons is directed into nonlinear regimes where sequential, multi-photon absorption processes are prevalent \cite{Rohringer2007.PRA}. XFEL experiments with gaseous samples like neon \cite{Young2010.N} or xenon \cite{Rudek2012.NP} have for instance proven the production of high charge states during a single pulse. It was even possible to follow the sequence of the individual ionization processes. In the case of neon for instance, 2 keV photons have produced charge states up to fully ionized neon cores via a repeated sequence of inner-shell photon absorption and subsequent Auger decay \cite{Young2010.N}. The photoionization of valence electrons only plays a role at the end of the ionization chain for highly charged ions or in the case of lower photon energies where inner-shell photoionization is energetically no longer possible. 

In scenarios with solid-state targets, photoionization via the XFEL can also play an important role. For instance in Ref.~\cite{Nagler2009.NP} it has been shown that the absorption of intense x-ray pulses with a photon energy of 92~eV turns solid aluminum transparent for the impinging x-rays in a timescale shorter than the pulse duration. By increasing the intensity further, XFELs have moreover the potential to create new states of matter. In 2012, the creation of an aluminum plasma with an XFEL has been experimentally demonstrated \cite{Vinko2012.N}. Laser light with a photon energy up to 1.8~keV and an intensity larger than $10^{17}$~W/cm$^2$ has been used. Plasma states at solid-state density with temperatures in excess of $10^6$ K could be created due to the unique light-matter interaction in this wavelength regime and the characteristic XFEL properties.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{pics/Mo-attenuation-pyth.eps}
\caption{Attenuation coefficient for molybdenum. The contributions from the photoelectric effect (red curve), Compton scattering (green curve) and pair production (blue curve) are shown in dependence of the photon energy. The data is taken from \cite{XCOM}.}
\label{fig:attenuation}
\end{figure}

The light-matter interaction between keV radiation and mid-$Z$ materials is predominantly dictated by the photoelectric effect as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:attenuation} for the example of molybdenum. Compton scattering is in this case orders of magnitude smaller and pair production is energetically forbidden for photon energies below 1.022~MeV. The photoelectric effect prefers the interaction with deeply bound electrons which leads to inner-shell photoionization if the photon energy is higher than the corresponding ionization potential. At the small energy tail of the red curve in Fig.~\ref{fig:attenuation}, the so-called ionization edges can be seen. This stepwise increase of the attenuation coefficient is caused by reaching the ionization energy of a new shell. In Fig.~\ref{fig:attenuation}, the $L$-shell edge at a photon energy of around 2.5 keV and the $K$-shell edge at approx.~20 keV are visible. Generally, the probability of interaction via the photoelectric effect decreases exponentially with increasing photon energy.

In contrast to optical or infrared photons, x-rays are not only able to produce directly inner-shell holes by photoionization, but also penetrate much further into the material leading to a very uniform energy deposition of the XFEL pulse inside the target. Moreover, the heating of the solid-state sample by a laser pulse with a duration around 100~fs occurs very rapidly. On this time scale the ionic motion is negligible, resulting in a plasma with near to solid-state density. This rapid, isochoric heating of the plasma (the volume is nearly unaffected during the formation process) leads to uniform temperature and density distributions immediately after the interaction with the XFEL pulse. The plasma expansion after the creation process evolves hydrodynamically along isentropes \cite{Tesla-TDR-2001}. The ability to vary the initial temperature over a wide range while keeping the initial density at its solid-state value offers the possibility to gain insights into the plasma creation and evolution in so far unexplored temperature-density regions \cite{Tesla-TDR-2001}.

In such plasma environments, nuclear effects can engage an important role. For instance, the presence of free electrons and atomic vacancies renders the occurrence of exotic nuclear processes from the coupling to the atomic shell possible. In the case of XFEL-induced plasmas, such secondary nuclear excitation processes can potentially compete with the direct photoexcitation via the laser pulse. Possible secondary nuclear excitation channels are:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Photoexcitation via secondary photons present in the plasma.
\item Coulomb excitation (inelastic electron scattering).
\item Nuclear processes coupled to the atomic shell:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Nuclear Excitation by Electron Capture (NEEC).
  \item Nuclear Excitation by Electron Transition (NEET).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
%
These plasma-mediated nuclear excitation mechanisms have already been investigated in hot, dense astrophysical \cite{Gosselin2004.PRC, Morel2004.PRA, Gosselin2007.PRC, Morel2010.PRC, Stephan2014.PRC} and optical laser-produced plasmas \cite{Harston1999.PRC}. The excitation of low-lying nuclear transitions as well as the enhanced nuclear level decay of isomers like ${}^{235\rm{m}}$U, ${}^{201\rm{m}}$Hg and ${}^{93\rm{m}}$Mo has been analyzed under local thermal equilibrium and non-local thermal equilibrium conditions. Typically, the microscopic excitation mechanism is treated independently of the thermodynamic plasma environment. More advanced approaches treating the nuclear excitation mechanism in contact with the thermodynamic environment are rather seldom \cite{Niez2002, Niez2003.PRC}.

In the case of cold, high-density plasmas, nuclear processes coupling to the atomic shell are expected to engage a dominant role among the secondary excitation channels. In this Thesis, we restrict ourselves to the process of NEEC. In the resonant process of NEEC, a free electron is captured into a bound atomic state by the simultaneous excitation of the nucleus as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:competition}. NEEC is investigated as plasma-mediated, secondary nuclear excitation channel in a scenario initially designed for the observation of the direct, resonant nuclear photoexcitation via the XFEL. In distinction to previous works, the XFEL not only grants access to parameter regimes of unexplored temperatures and densities, but also offers the possibility to study the competition between direct and secondary excitation mechanisms not available in laboratory plasmas generated by optical lasers \cite{KenL2000.PRL, Cowan2000.PRL, Gibbon2005.Book, Spohr2008.NJP, Mourou2011.S}.

\caption{Competition of direct and secondary nuclear excitation. The super-intense XFEL is able to resonantly drive low-lying nuclear transitions in the keV regime via photoexcitation (laser stage). If the laser intensity is high enough, a plasma can be created where secondary nuclear excitation channels come into play, e.g., NEEC (plasma stage).}

The evaluation of possible secondary effects in nuclear photoexcitation studies with the XFEL is the topic of Part \ref{part:excitation} of this Thesis. The XFEL-induced excitation in solid-state nuclear targets can be split into two stages. In the time period when the XFEL pulse is present (a typical value for the pulse duration is 100~fs), the nuclei inside the solid-state target can be resonantly driven by the laser-nucleus interaction which is referred to as laser stage in Fig.~\ref{fig:competition}. The theoretical treatment of the resonant nuclear photoexcitation by the XFEL is presented in Chap.~\ref{chap:bloch}. During the laser stage, the interaction with the electrons may lead to the formation of a plasma. In the plasma stage (in principle also during but mostly after the laser interaction) secondary processes like NEEC become possible. The microscopic NEEC process is presented in Chap.~\ref{chap:NEEC}. Both the laser-induced photoexcitation and the plasma-mediated NEEC channels contribute to the final nuclear excitation rate. In Chap.~\ref{chap:direct-secondary}, it is exactly this competition between the direct excitation in the laser stage and the secondary NEEC channel in the plasma stage that is investigated. The specific examples of ${}^{93\rm{m}}$Mo isomer triggering and the driving of ${}^{57}$Fe from the ground to the first excited state are discussed. It turns out that secondary NEEC gives the dominant contribution in the case of the ${}^{93\rm{m}}$Mo depletion, whereas it can be safely neglected for ${}^{57}$Fe targets.


%First, the theoretical treatment of the individual processes, the laser-induced excitation and NEEC, is introduced in Chap.~\ref{chap:bloch} and Chap.~\ref{chap:NEEC}, respectively. Afterwards in Chap.~\ref{chap:direct-secondary}, we explore the competition between the direct photoexcitation and secondary NEEC. The specific examples of ${}^{93\rm{m}}$Mo isomer triggering and the driving of ${}^{57}$Fe from the ground to the first excited state are discussed. It will turn out that secondary NEEC gives the dominant contribution in the case of the ${}^{93\rm{m}}$Mo depletion, whereas it can be safely neglected for ${}^{57}$Fe targets.
