\subsubsection*{Spectroscopy of atoms, picture of atoms in general}
\begin{itemize}
\item
review picture of atom and structure of atom (beginning with rutherford's experiment)\\
review history of spectroscopy of atoms and connection to development of theories\\
(discrete spectrum -> quantum mechanics; finestructure -> dirac eq.; lambshift,hfs -> finite nuclear size, qed). \\
Also mention recent development (H precision spectroscopy, highly charged ions, x ray spectr., microwave spectr.)\\
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{bound electron g factor}
\begin{itemize}
\item
history of measurements and theory (Zeeman). recent project (heaviest highly charged ions). 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{muonic atoms}
\begin{itemize}
\item
explain field of exotic atoms (positronium, muonium, true muonium, pionic atoms, muonic atoms) and which regimes can be tested with them. Give more details about muonic atoms, history of findings and results. Describe the new experiments at psi.
\item 
explain proton radius puzzle as a motivation for more experiments on muonic systems
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection*{Structure of the Thesis}

Explain the structure here.
