Advances in the field of spectroscopy have always given new insights in the physical laws which govern our world at the smallest scales. %or the microcosm
The first observation of a discrete absorption spectrum was due to Wollaston in 1802~\cite{wollaston1802} and Fraunhofer in 1814~\cite{fraunhofer1817}, who discovered the Fraunhofer lines in the spectrum of the sun independently from each other.
In the following decades, the emission spectra of different elements were explored, especially noteworthy are the systematic investigations by Kirchhoff and Bunsen~\cite{kirchhoff1860,kirchhoff1861}. It became apparent that elements can be identified by their characteristic spectrum and that laboratory emission spectra are connected to astrophysical absorption spectra~\cite{angstrom1862}.
Since the hydrogen atom consists of only one electron bound to a single proton, it has the simplest spectrum and therefore was particularly important for the development of theoretical models. It was recognized by Balmer in 1885~\cite{balmer1885} that the position of spectral lines as measured by Ångström~\cite{angstrom1853}, Huggins~\cite{huggins1880}, and Vogel~\cite{vogel1880} could be described with surprising accuracy by a simple formula. This was generalized later in terms of the Rydberg formula~\cite{rydberg1889,martinson2005}. It contains the Balmer series as a special case and also predicts the Lyman, Paschen, Brackett, Pfund, and Humphreys series, which were confirmed subsequently by experiments~\cite{lyman1906,paschen1908,brackett1922,pfund1924,humphrey1953}. However, the Rydberg formula is purely empirical, without an underlying theoretical framework.

Additionally, the electron was discovered by the investigation of cathode rays~\cite{thomson1897,rechenberg1997} and Rutherford scattering showed that the positive charge and almost the entire mass of an atom is concentrated in its center in for of an atomic nucleus~\cite{rutherford1911}. Also, the spectral density of black-body radiation was explained by Planck using the quantum hypothesis~\cite{planck1978}. This motivated the Bohr model of the atom~\cite{bohr1913}, where the electron can orbit the nucleus only on certain quantized orbits. Compared to the previous Thomson~\cite{thomson1904} and Rutherford model, now the Rydberg formula and thereby the hydrogen spectrum could be derived and the Rydberg constant could be expressed in terms of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$, the electron mass $m_e$, the speed of light $c$, and the Planck's constant $h$. A relativistic extension is the Bohr-Sommerfeld model~\cite{sommerfeld1916}, which explains also finer features of the hydrogen spectrum.
However, despite the success of describing the quantized energies, the Bohr-Sommerfeld model has difficulties with the generalization to many-electron systems. A consistent theoretical framework for non-relativistic atomic theory, also for more complicated atoms, was obtained with the Schrödinger equation~\cite{schrodinger1926_1,schrodinger1926_2,schrodinger1926_3,schrodinger1926_4} and matrix mechanics~\cite{heisenberg1925,born1925,born1926}, which were shown to be an equivalent formulation of quantum theory~\cite{schrodinger1926_5}.
