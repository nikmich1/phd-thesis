Advances in the field of spectroscopy have always given new insights in the physical laws which govern our world at the smallest scales. %or the microcosm
The first observation of a discrete absorption spectrum was due to Wollaston in 1802~\cite{wollaston1802} and Fraunhofer in 1814~\cite{fraunhofer1817}, who discovered the Fraunhofer lines in the spectrum of the sun independently from each other.
In the following decades, the emission spectra of different elements were explored, especially noteworthy are the systematic investigations by Kirchhoff and Bunsen~\cite{kirchhoff1860,kirchhoff1861}. It became apparent that elements can be identified by their characteristic spectrum and that laboratory emission spectra are connected to astrophysical absorption spectra~\cite{angstrom1862}.
Since the hydrogen atom consists of only one electron bound to a single proton, it has the simplest spectrum and therefore was particularly important for the development of theoretical models. It was recognized by Balmer in 1885~\cite{balmer1885} that the position of spectral lines as measured by Ångström~\cite{angstrom1853}, Huggins~\cite{huggins1880}, and Vogel~\cite{vogel1880} could be described with surprising accuracy by a simple formula. This was generalized later in terms of the Rydberg formula~\cite{rydberg1889,martinson2005}. It contains the Balmer series as a special case and also predicts the Lyman, Paschen, Brackett, Pfund, and Humphreys series, which were confirmed subsequently by experiments~\cite{lyman1906,paschen1908,brackett1922,pfund1924,humphrey1953}. However, the Rydberg formula is purely empirical, without an underlying theoretical framework.

Additionally, the electron was discovered by the investigation of cathode rays~\cite{thomson1897,rechenberg1997} and Rutherford scattering showed that the positive charge and almost the entire mass of an atom is concentrated in its center in form of an atomic nucleus~\cite{rutherford1911}. Also, the spectral density of black-body radiation was explained by Planck using the quantum hypothesis~\cite{planck1978}. This motivated the Bohr model of the atom~\cite{bohr1913}, where the electron can orbit around the nucleus only on certain quantized orbits. Compared to the previous Thomson~\cite{thomson1904} and Rutherford model, now the Rydberg formula and thereby the hydrogen spectrum could be derived and the discrete energies could be expressed in terms of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$, the electron mass $m_e$, and the speed of light $c$. A relativistic extension is the Bohr-Sommerfeld model~\cite{sommerfeld1916}, which explains also finer features of the hydrogen spectrum.
However, despite the success of describing the quantized energies, the Bohr-Sommerfeld model has difficulties with the generalization to many-electron systems. A consistent theoretical framework for non-relativistic atomic theory, also for more complicated atoms, was finally obtained with the Schrödinger equation~\cite{schrodinger1926_1,schrodinger1926_2,schrodinger1926_3,schrodinger1926_4} and matrix mechanics~\cite{heisenberg1925,born1925,born1926}, which were shown to be an equivalent formulation of quantum theory~\cite{schrodinger1926_5}.
Due to the Zeeman effect~\cite{zeeman1896}, spectral lines of atoms exposed to magnetic field are split into sub levels. This could only be explained consistently by assigning, besides the orbital angular momentum, also the spin angular momentum to the electron~\cite{uhlenbeck1925}. The Dirac equation~\cite{dirac1928} incorporates the electron's spin naturally and predicts correctly, that the corresponding magnetic moment due to spin is twice as big compared to orbital angular momentum. Additionally, it obeys the laws of special relativity and negative energy states occur, which led to the prediction of the positron, the electron's antiparticle. The negative energy states also lead to problems with the one-particle interpretation of the Dirac equation due to phenomena like Zitterbewegung or Klein's paradox~\cite{the_dirac_eq}.

Two experimental results pointed out that the Dirac equation, despite its success in describing the fine structure of the hydrogen atom, could not be the end of the story for the theory of atomic structure. On the one hand, the $2s\nicefrac{1}{2}$ and $2p\nicefrac{1}{2}$ levels should be degenerate according to Dirac's theory. However, Lamb and Retherford showed that they are separated by about $1060\,\rm{MHz}$ by driving the transition directly with radio waves~\cite{lamb1947}. On the other hand, anomalies in the magnetic hyperfine structure of hydrogen and deuterium~\cite{nafe1947} as well as sodium and gallium~\cite{kusch1947,kusch1948} were revealed. Both phenomena were explained in the framework of quantum electrodynamics (QED)~\cite{schwinger1948}, which results in small corrections to the energy levels in atoms and the magnetic moment of the electron. To this date, the comparison of experiment and theory for the hyperfine and Zeeman splitting in simple atomic systems keeps challenging QED and delivering values for fundamental physical constants~\cite{haensch1979}. The following two paragraphs describe more recent developments in this field.\\[11pt]
The magnetic moment of the electron is commonly expressed by the dimensionless gyromagnetic factor, or $g$ factor, which is the proportionality constant between magnetic moment and angular momentum. The $g$ factor of the free electron provides a stringent test of QED without an external electromagnetic field. It was measured with an uncertainty below the part-per-trillion level~\cite{odom2006,hanneke2008} and predicted to order $\alpha^5$ theoretically, eg.~\cite{kinoshita2006,aoyama2007,aoyama2015,aoyama2017}. A combination of experiment and theory allowed the extraction of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ on the parts-per-billion level~\cite{gabrielse2006,gabrielse2007}.

The $g$ factor of the electron can also be measured and theoretically calculated to an extraordinary precision in case of the bound electron in a hydrogen-like (H-like) ion. Here, QED can be tested in the regime of high background fields, since the electron is exposed to the nuclear Coulomb potential. It has been measured for H-like $^{12}_{\phantom{0}6}\rm{C}^{5+}$~\cite{Haffner2000,Sturm2014}, $^{16}_{\phantom{0}8}\rm{O}^{7+}$~\cite{Verdu2004}, and $^{28}_{14}\rm{Si}^{13+}$~\cite{Sturm2011} on the part-per-billion level with Penning trap experiments using a single ion during the \textit{Mainz $g$-Factor Experiment}. A Penning trap is a device for trapping charged particles with a combination of a static electric quadrupole field and a homogeneous magnetic field~\cite{geoniumtheory}. For these measurements, at least two Penning traps are used~\cite{annphysgfactor}. One trap is for detection of spin states with a magnetic field inhomogeneity, and in one trap with a very homogeneous magnetic field the actual spin flips are performed.

In the near future, two experiments will measure the bound electron $g$ factor in H-like ions also for very high charge numbers. The \textit{ALPHATRAP} experiment~\cite{sturm2017} will use a measurement scheme with two Penning traps similar to the \textit{Mainz $g$-Factor Experiment}. Now, the ions will not be created in situ but can be injected from external sources, like the \textit{Heidelberg EBIT} (electron-beam ion trap). In this way, $g$ factors of ions up to H-like $^{208}\rm{Pb}^{81+}$ can be investigated with an expected accuracy of 10 parts-per-trillion~\cite{sturm2017}. The \textit{ARTEMIS} experiment~\cite{vogel2013,sturm2017} will use microwaves to excite transitions between Zeeman sublevels in highly charged ions. In this way, ionic and bound electron $g$ factors can be accessed. With connection to the \textit{HITRAP} beamline, the heaviest hydrogen-like ions, e.g. $\rm{U}^{91+}$, will be available~\cite{vogel2015}.

The precision experiments on the bound electron $g$ factor demand theoretical calculations on a competing level of accuracy. The interaction of a bound electron with the atomic nucleus is characterized by the parameter $Z\alpha$, where $Z$ is the nuclear charge number and $\alpha \sim 1/137$ the fine-structure constant. For light nuclei, $Z\alpha$ is a small parameters and a power-series expansion is feasable. On the other hand, for heavy nuclei $Z\alpha$ is on the order of unity and results have to be obtained to all orders. %
%Breit term
The leading contribution to the binding corrections of the bound-electron $g$ factor is due to the point-like Coulomb potential and has been obtained by Breit~\cite{breit1928}.
%QED
The one- and two-loop vacuum-polarization (VP) and self-energy (SE) corrections have been obtained to order $(Z\alpha)^4$ in~\cite{karshenboim2000,Pachucki2004,pachucki2004_err,Pachucki2005}. 
Two-loop corrections to order $(Z\alpha)^5$ have been recently presented in~\cite{czarnecki2018}.
The most precise one-loop QED correction for the SE to all orders in $Z\alpha$ has been calculated in~\cite{yerokhin2017}.
Two-loop calculations to all orders in $Z\alpha$ have not been completed to date. The have been presented for two VP loops and mixed VP-SE in~\cite{yerokhin2013}, and for the SE loop-after-loop terms in~\cite{sikora2018_arxiv}.

%nuclear effects
Furthermore, nuclear effects beyond the point-like Coulomb potential have to be considered. Although the nucleus is much smaller than the typical extend of the electron wave function, it is an extended object and correspondingly, the Coulomb potential is modified at small distanced. This causes the finite nuclear size correction to the $g$ factor of the bound electron. The relativistic analytic formula for this has been given in~\cite{Glazov2002} and the corresponding non-relativistic limit in~\cite{karshenboim2000}. In two-photon exchanges, also excited nuclear states contribute and the nuclear polarization corrections have been considered in~\cite{Nefiodov,volotka2014}. The nuclear recoil corrections are due to the finite nuclear mass. Here, besides $\alpha$ for QED loops and $Z\alpha$ for interactions with the nuclear potential, there is the additional expansion parameter $m_e/M$, where $m_e$ is the electron mass and $M$ the nuclear mass. To order $\alpha(Z\alpha)^2(m_e/M)^2$, results can be found in~\cite{pachucki2010,eides2010}. Suitable for heavy ions, the recoil correction to first order in $m_e/M$, but all orders in $Z\alpha$, is given in~\cite{shabaev2001}. 
%introduce nuclear shape and motivate work in this thesis
In~\cite{jacek2012}, the nuclear shape effect, also called nuclear deformation effect, was introduced for spinless nuclei, which takes a deformed nuclear charge distribution into account. It is not important for light nuclei, but scales strongly with the nuclear charge and therefore becomes important for high $Z$. 

%outlook/outline
The combination of theory and experiment for the bound electron $g$ factor in $^{12}_{\phantom{0}6}$C provided an improved value of the electron mass~\cite{Sturm2014,Zatorski2017}. For $^{28}_{14}$Si~\cite{Sturm2011}, it was shown as a proof-of-principle that nuclear parameters like the RMS charge radius can be obtained. Extracting nuclear magnetic moments was suggested theoretically~\cite{Yerokhin2011,Werth2001}. Also, it was argued that an independent and more accurate value for the fine-structure constant can be obtained~\cite{Shabaev2006,yerokhin2016}. With the upcoming experiments in the high-$Z$ regime, further tests of QED in stong fields, information on nuclear parameters, and extraction of fundamental constants can be expected, and updated theoretical calculations especially for heavy nuclei are needed. To date, the nuclear deformation correction was calculated with perturbative methods only. This thesis contributes to the theory landscape by investigating the nuclear deformation correction non-perturbatively with numerical methods.\\[11pt]
For further studies of H-like systems, either the atomic nucleus or the bound electron can be exchanged for another charged particle. This establishes the field of research on \textit{exotic atoms}.
