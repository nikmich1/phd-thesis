\chapter{Polarization control of hard x-rays}
\label{chap:pol-control}

The controlled manipulation of nuclear forward scattering (NFS) has been investigated in a number of setups over the last decades including phase shifts \cite{Helisto1991.PRL, Olga2011.PRA}, vibrating targets \cite{Shvydko1992.JOP, Vagizov2014}, sequences of multiple targets \cite{Kohn1995.JOP, Smirnov2005.PRA}, magnetic fields rotations \cite{Shvydko1993.JOP, Shvydko1994.HI, Shvydko1996.PRL, Wente2012-storage}, external field control \cite{Kocharovskaya1999, Coussement2002.PRL, Wente2014-GPE, Xiangjin2014}, or radio-frequency fields \cite{Shvydko1993.EPL, Smirnov1999.HI-ultrasound}.

The idea to actively manipulate the nuclear response in the course of NFS with SR by abrupt changes of the magnetic field goes back to Shvyd'ko \cite{Shvydko1994.HI}. In a subsequent work \cite{Shvydko1996.PRL} it was experimentally and theoretically shown that a single x-ray photon can be stored inside an ${}^{57}$Fe target by dynamically controlling the nuclear response via timed rotations of the magnetic field. Depending on the moment of field switching, the collective nuclear decay could be suppressed. 

%Synchrotron light has been used to resonantly drive the 14.4~keV M\"{o}ssbauer transition in ${}^{57}$Fe from the ground ($I_{\rm{g}}=1/2$) to the first excited state ($I_{\rm{e}}=3/2$). The presence of a magnetic field splits each nuclear state into its Zeeman levels (see Fig~\ref{fig:current-redistribution}). In Ref.~\cite{Shvydko1996.PRL}, the magnetic field direction and the incident polarization has been chosen such that only transitions could be driven without change in the nuclear spin projection quantum number, $\Delta M=0$. Depending on the moment of field switching, the collective nuclear response has been manipulated.

In order to be able to apply a B-field rotation timely synchronized with the nuclear excitation, it is mandatory to have a sharp excitation pulse in time space. It is therefore natural to consider SR facilities as x-ray sources because the pulse duration behaves $\delta$-like in time in comparison with the time scale of the nuclear response. Furthermore, the low degeneracy of synchrotron light with regard to the nuclear transition width ensures the weak excitation regime and hence the single-photon character of the control procedure described in this Chapter. A typical NFS setup at SR facilities is depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:NFS-setup} along with the characteristic time spectrum for a static magnetic field.

This Chapter is devoted to the polarization control of hard x-rays during NFS based on dynamical manipulation via magnetic field rotations. In Sec.~\ref{sec:pol-static}, the polarization response of NFS is first discussed for static hyperfine interactions. Afterwards in Sec.~\ref{sec:pol-control}, the single scattering approximation is used to derive a control procedure of the polarization response. This section is based on results presented in Refs.~\cite{Shvydko1994.HI, Shvydko1996.PRL} and extends the concepts to the domain of polarization control with applications in quantum information science. How to obtain control of the output field beyond the first scattering order is the topic of Sec.~\ref{sec:beyond-first-order}. There, the formalism of Ref.~\cite{Shvydko1996.PRL} is extended beyond the single scattering approximation.

\section{Polarization effects in static NFS}
\label{sec:pol-static}

Before we explain how the polarization of hard x-rays can be dynamically manipulated in the course of nuclear forward scattering, let us discuss the polarization properties of NFS for a static hyperfine field. The case of static hyperfine interactions has been treated in Sec.~\ref{sec:static-hf}. The corresponding interaction Hamiltonian is given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:NFS_Hamiltonian-hf-static}. 
Following the notation of the previous Chapter, the polarization of the incident SR pulse is denoted by $\bm{e}_{\rm{p}}$ [compare Eq.~\eqref{eq:NFS_scattering-ampl-boundary-delta}]. The linear polarization basis vectors $\bm{e}_{s}$ ($s=\sigma,\pi$) are defined by convention in the following way
%
\begin{align}
\bm{e}_{\sigma} &= \bm{e}_{x}\ , \nonumber \\
\bm{e}_{\pi} &= \bm{e}_{z}\ .
\label{eq:sigma-pi}
\end{align}
%
The definition of $\sigma$- and $\pi$-polarization thereby follows the conventions settled in the description of SR pulses \cite{Siddons1999.HI}. If the electric field vector is in the horizontal plane, it is referred to as $\sigma$-polarized. The $\pi$-polarization vector is then subsequently determined by $\bm{e}_{\sigma} \times \bm{k}/k$ where $\bm{k}$ is the wave vector of the incident field, here $\bm{k} \parallel \bm{e}_{y}$.

Analogously to the linear polarization vectors, circular polarization basis vectors can be defined by
\begin{align}
\bm{e}_{+} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \bm{e}_{x} + \i \bm{e}_{z} \right)\ , \nonumber \\
\bm{e}_{-} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \bm{e}_{x} - \i \bm{e}_{z} \right)\ ,
\label{eq:left-right}
\end{align}
where the right- and left-circular polarizations $\bm{e}_{+}$ and $\bm{e}_{-}$ have positive and negative helicities, respectively.

%[selection rules - strong dependence on B-field direction]

Since it turns out that the polarization state of the scattered light is strongly dependent on the magnetic field orientation determining the quantization axis of the system, it is helpful to distinguish particular B-field geometries:
\begin{itemize}
\item In the \textbf{Voigt geometry} the magnetic field vector lies in the plane perpendicular to the propagation direction of the incident electromagnetic field. Especially interesting are the cases where $\bm{B} \parallel \bm{e}_{\sigma}$ and $\bm{B} \parallel \bm{e}_{\pi}$ which are henceforth denoted by $0^{\circ}$- and $90^{\circ}$-Voigt geometries, respectively.
\item The \textbf{Faraday geometry} is defined by a magnetic field parallel or anti-parallel to the wave vector of the incident radiation: $\bm{B} \parallel \bm{k}$ or $\bm{B} \parallel -\bm{k}$.
\end{itemize}


In order to simplify the discussion of the polarization properties of the electric field after NFS only electric and magnetic dipole transitions ($\mathcal{E}1$ and $\mathcal{M}1$) are considered. From the recursive solution for static hyperfine fields given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:NFS_scattering-ampl-solution-single} it can be verified that the $s$-component of the scattered radiation is proportional to $( \bm{j}_{\ell}(\bm{k}) \cdot \bm{e}_{s} ) ( \bm{j}_{\ell}^*(\bm{k}) \cdot \bm{e}_{s'} )$ where $s'$ denotes the incident polarization. For the case of a $0^{\circ}$- or $90^{\circ}$-Voigt geometry the following relation can be shown to hold \cite{Shvydko1992.JOP, Shvydko1993.JOP},
\begin{equation}
\Big( \bm{j}_{\ell}(\bm{k}) \cdot \bm{e}_{s} \Big) \Big( \bm{j}_{\ell}^*(\bm{k}) \cdot \bm{e}_{s'} \Big) \propto \delta_{s,s'} \qquad \mathrm{with}\quad s,s' \in (\sigma,\pi)\ .
\label{eq:pol-static}
\end{equation}
This means for incident linearly polarized light the $0^{\circ}$- and $90^{\circ}$-Voigt geometry prohibits the mixing of $\sigma$- and $\pi$-polarization. In other words, if the SR pulse is either $\sigma$- or $\pi$-polarized, the radiation is scattered into its initial polarization state.

A way to understand the polarization dependence of NFS is to consider the indistinguishability required for the formation of the nuclear exciton. As already explained in Chapter \ref{chap:NFS}, the directionality of NFS goes back to the formation of a delocalized nuclear excitation inside the target for which the indistinguishability of the scattering process is mandatory. For this reason, the photons emitted preferably in the forward direction occur in scattering processes for which the nucleus decays back to the same magnetic sublevel from where it was excited. For instance, in the case of a $\sigma$-polarized SR pulse which drives a nuclear target inside a magnetic field pointing along the $z$-direction, only transitions with $\Delta M = 0$ can be driven. The second scalar product in Eq.~\eqref{eq:pol-static} determining the selection rules of the excitation vanishes for all other transitions. Since in the case of $\bm{B} \parallel \bm{e}_{\pi}$ the transition amplitudes of the $\Delta M = 0$ transitions are additionally perpendicular to the $\pi$-component $\bm{e}_{\pi}$, the indistinguishability of the process ensures the conservation of the incoming polarization.

For arbitrary B-field orientations Eq.~\eqref{eq:pol-static} does not hold anymore such that $\sigma$-polarized x-rays can be scattered into $\pi$-polarized states, and the other way around \cite{Siddons1999.HI}. However, in the case of a Voigt geometry it is always possible to find two orthogonal polarization vectors (namely the vectors parallel and perpendicular to $\bm{B}$) for which the relation \eqref{eq:pol-static} is fulfilled.

In the case of a magnetic field pointing along the propagation direction of the incident wave, polarization mixing between the linear polarizations $\bm{e}_{\sigma}$ and $\bm{e}_{\pi}$ always occurs. However, in the Faraday geometry circular polarization states are conserved \cite{Siddons1999.HI}. Hence, Eq.~\eqref{eq:pol-static} holds for the Faraday geometry if $s$ and $s'$ are replaced by circular polarizations.

Accordingly, nuclear forward scattering does not conserve in general the polarization state of the scattered x-rays \cite{Siddons1999.HI}. However, there are particular geometries determined by the orientation of the magnetic field where polarization mixing is forbidden. In the following section it is shown that the scattered light polarization can be dynamically controlled by switchings between these geometries.

\section{Dynamical control of nuclear polarization response}
\label{sec:pol-control}

The general concept for the polarization control is to instantaneously jump between polarization eigengeometries of NFS potentially leading to transformations between orthogonal polarization states. The description of such abrupt changes of the magnetic field direction in terms of the hyperfine interaction Hamiltonian $H_{\rm{hf}}$ has been the topic of Sec.~\ref{sec:rot-hf}. For the specific form of $H_{\rm{hf}}$ given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:NFS_Hamiltonian-hf-rot}, the resulting nuclear transition currents $\bm{J}_{\ell}^*$ and $\bm{J}_{\ell}$ are summarized in Eqs.~\eqref{eq:NFS_nucl-current-rot}. Here, we apply these results to explicitly derive the scattered radiation field. It turns out that the polarization response of the nuclear target is not only affected by the angle and axis of rotation, but also strongly depends on the moment of magnetic field rotation.

The first order scattering amplitude for a $\delta$-like excitation pulse with polarization $\bm{e} _{\rm{p}}$ is given by Eq.~(\ref{eq:NFS_scattering-ampl-1st-delta}). Plugging the explicit time dependence of the nuclear currents (\ref{eq:NFS_nucl-current-static}) into Eq.~(\ref{eq:NFS_scattering-ampl-1st-delta}), the first order solution can be written for $0<\tau<\tau_0$ as
\begin{align}
\bm{E}^{(1)}(\xi,\tau) &= -\xi \sum_{\ell} \bm{J}_{\ell,\mathrm{I}}(\bm{k},\tau) \left( \bm{J}_{\ell,\mathrm{I}}^{*}(\bm{k},0) \cdot \bm{e} _{\rm{p}}\right) \nonumber \\
&= -\xi \sum_{\ell} \bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{I}}(\bm{k}) \, \e^{-\i \Omega_{\ell} \tau - \tau/2}\ .
\label{eq:field-I}
\end{align}
Accordingly, the single scattering events can be expressed as a coherent summation over all contributing nuclear transitions $\ell$ where the summands factorize into a time-dependent phase factor $\e^{-\i \Omega_{\ell} \tau - \tau/2}$ and a time-independent amplitude $\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{I}}$ which is determined by
\begin{equation}
\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{I}}(\bm{k}) = \bm{j}_{\ell,\mathrm{I}}(\bm{k}) \left( \bm{j}_{\ell,\mathrm{I}}^{*}(\bm{k}) \cdot \bm{e} _{\rm{p}} \right)\ .
\label{eq:amplitude-I}
\end{equation}

In order to describe the scattered radiation field after an instantaneous B-field rotation at $\tau=\tau_0$, the transformation of the nuclear transition currents described in Eqs.~(\ref{eq:NFS_nucl-current-rot}) is considered. The first order solution for $\tau>\tau_0$ reads
\begin{align}
\bm{E}^{(1)}(\xi,\tau) &= -\xi \sum_{\ell} \bm{J}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}(\bm{k},\tau) \left( \bm{J}_{\ell,\mathrm{I}}^{*}(\bm{k},0) \cdot \bm{e} _{\rm{p}}\right) \nonumber \\
&= -\xi \sum_{\ell} \bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}(\bm{k}) \, \e^{-\i \Omega_{\ell} (\tau-\tau_0) - \tau/2}\ ,
\label{eq:field-II}
\end{align}
where the time-independent amplitude is defined by
\begin{equation}
\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}(\bm{k}) = \bm{j}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}(\bm{k}) \sum_{\ell'} \e^{-\i \Omega_{\ell'} \tau_0} \mathcal{D}_{M _{\rm{g}}M _{\rm{g}}'}^{I _{\rm{g}}}(\alpha,\beta,\gamma) \mathcal{D}_{M _{\rm{e}}M _{\rm{e}}'}^{I _{\rm{e}} \,*}(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)  \left( \bm{j}_{\ell',\mathrm{I}}^{*}(\bm{k}) \cdot \bm{e} _{\rm{p}} \right)\ .
\label{eq:amplitude-II}
\end{equation}
As seen from Eq.~(\ref{eq:field-II}), the single scattering solution for $\tau>\tau_0$ has still the same form as Eq.~(\ref{eq:field-I}) with the replacements $\tau \mapsto \tau-\tau_0$ (except in the decay factor $\e^{-\tau/2}$) and $\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{I}} \mapsto \bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$. The time-independent amplitude $\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$ looks however completely different from $\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{I}}$. The most essential feature is that $\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$ depends first on the geometry of magnetic field rotation determined by the Euler angles $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$, and second on the moment of switching $\tau_0$. Since both dependencies are adjustable from outside they can be used as control parameters for the amplitude $\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$ which renders possible to actively manipulate the magnitude and direction of the scattered radiation field for $\tau>\tau_0$.

Physically, Eq.~(\ref{eq:amplitude-II}) describes a redistribution of the nuclear excitation among the Zeeman levels due to a change of the quantization axis produced by the instantaneous rotation of the magnetic hyperfine field. The initial excitation process is described by the scalar product $\bm{j}_{\ell',\mathrm{I}}^{*} \cdot \bm{e} _{\rm{p}}$ which is still evaluated in the time section where the magnetic field is given by $\bm{B}_{\mathrm{I}}$. The abrupt B-field rotation transforms these initially excited currents into a multiplet of currents determined by the new quantization axis. The dependence of this transformation on the rotation geometry and the moment of switching is determined by the product of Wigner rotation matrices $\mathcal{D}_{M _{\rm{g}}M _{\rm{g}}'}^{I _{\rm{g}}} \mathcal{D}_{M _{\rm{e}}M _{\rm{e}}'}^{I _{\rm{e}} \,*}$ and the phase factor $\e^{-\i \Omega_{\ell'} \tau_0}$, respectively, which act as weighting coefficients for the nuclear redistribution. The deexcitation process proceeds via the transition amplitudes $\bm{j}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$ which are determined by the new magnetic field direction $\bm{B}_{\mathrm{II}}$. By adjusting the rotation parameters it is possible to actively manipulate the interplay between the decay transition amplitudes $\bm{j}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$ such that the polarization response of the nuclear target can be controlled by tuning either on constructive or destructive interference \cite{Shvydko1996.PRL}.

%Physically, the instantaneous rotation of the magnetic hyperfine field provokes a redistribution of the nuclear excitation among the Zeeman levels. In terms of currents, this redistribution corresponds to a transformation of each nuclear current into an accumulation (in the case of ${}^{57}$Fe a sextet) of new currents which are determined by the new quantization axis of the system. The dependence of this transformation on the angle and the axis of rotation is determined by the Wigner rotation matrices which describe the change of the system's quantization axis. According to Eq.~\ref{}, the rotation matrices act as a kind of weight coefficients which determine the nuclear redistribution among the Zeeman levels. Beside the dependence on the geometrical rotation properties, Eq.~\ref{} is also strongly influenced by the time of rotation $t_0$. In the following, it is shown that by choosing $t_0$ the interplay between the redistributed currents can be actively manipulated such that it is possible to control the polarization response of the nuclear target by tuning either on constructive or destructive interference.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{pics/fe57_level_scheme_2g.pdf}
\caption{Initially $\sigma$-polarized x-rays are converted into $\pi$-polarization states by a timed rotation of the B-field from $z$ to $x$. Within the initial geometry only the two $\Delta M=0$ transitions are driven by the incident $\sigma$-polarized light. The instantaneous magnetic field rotation corresponds to an abrupt change of the quantization axis redistributing the excited nuclear currents. The moment of switching $\tau_0$ is chosen such that the ``new'' $\Delta M=\pm 1$ hyperfine transitions interfere destructively resulting in the emission of $\pi$-polarized x-rays after $\tau_0$.}
\label{fig:current-redistribution}
\end{figure}

For the case of ${}^{57}$Fe nuclei, this control procedure is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:current-redistribution}. Thereby, it is assumed that initially only the two $\Delta M=0$ transitions are driven, for instance by choosing $\sigma$-polarized SR and $\bm{B}_{\mathrm{I}}$ parallel to the $z$-direction. The abrupt rotation of the magnetic field transforms each of these currents into a sextet of new currents defined by the new magnetic field direction. The relative strengths and phases of the transformed currents are determined by the angle and axis of rotation and the moment of switching \cite{Shvydko1996.PRL}. Considering for instance a rotation from the $z$ to the $x$ direction, the switching time can be chosen such that the $\Delta M=\pm1$ transitions interfere destructively. In this case only the currents with $\Delta M=0$ survive as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:current-redistribution}. Since the deexcitation occurs in the presence of $\bm{B}_{\mathrm{II}}$ this scheme converts initially $\sigma$-polarized into $\pi$-polarized light.

In order to find the right switching time for $\sigma$ to $\pi$ conversion the amplitudes $\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$ need to be analyzed in detail. In the following, we specialize in ${}^{57}$Fe targets and restrict ourselves to 90$^{\circ}$ magnetic field rotations from $z$ to $x$ in order to elaborate the behavior of the NFS spectrum caused by the nuclear redistribution. Both the case of initially $\sigma$- and of $\pi$-polarized radiation are discussed. Subsequently, the effects caused by multiple scattering contributions are evaluated.
%Afterwards, a brief overview of rotations from and to the Faraday geometry is given for the sake of completeness.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\subsection{90$^{\circ}$-Voigt rotation: from $z$ to $x$}

In this subsection, we consider a rotation of the magnetic field initially pointing along the $z$-direction by 90$^{\circ}$ counterclockwise around the $y$-axis (propagation direction) as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:current-redistribution}. In terms of the Euler angles this rotation is characterized by \cite{Edmonds}
\begin{equation}
\alpha=0, \quad \beta=\frac{\pi}{2} \quad \text{and}\quad \gamma=0\ .
\label{eq:Euler}
\end{equation} 
Since both $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ identically vanish the Wigner $\mathcal{D}$-matrices occurring in Eq.~(\ref{eq:amplitude-II}) reduce to
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{D}_{M'M}^{I}(\alpha,\beta,\gamma) = \e^{-\i M' \alpha} d_{M'M}^{I}(\beta) \e^{-\i M \gamma} = d_{M'M}^{I}(\beta)\ ,
\label{eq:Wigner-simplify}
\end{equation}
where the small $d$-matrices describe a rotation about the $y$-axis \cite{Edmonds}. Inserting Eq.~(\ref{eq:Wigner-simplify}) into Eq.~(\ref{eq:amplitude-II}) and setting $\beta=\pi/2$ one obtains
\begin{equation}
\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}(\bm{k}) = \bm{j}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}(\bm{k}) \sum_{\ell'} \e^{-\i \Omega_{\ell'} \tau_0} d_{M _{\rm{g}}M _{\rm{g}}'}^{I _{\rm{g}}}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) d_{M _{\rm{e}}M _{\rm{e}}'}^{I _{\rm{e}}}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)  \left( \bm{j}_{\ell',\mathrm{I}}^{*}(\bm{k}) \cdot \bm{e} _{\rm{p}} \right)\ .
\label{eq:amplitude-II-simplify}
\end{equation}
Thereby we have taken into account that the $d$-matrices are chosen to be real. The explicit values of $d_{M _{\rm{e}}M _{\rm{e}}'}^{I _{\rm{e}}}(\frac{\pi}{2})$ and $d_{M _{\rm{g}}M _{\rm{g}}'}^{I _{\rm{g}}}(\frac{\pi}{2})$ for $I _{\rm{g}}$=1/2 and $I _{\rm{e}}$=3/2 can be found in App.~\ref{app:Voigt}. In order to further evaluate Eq.~(\ref{eq:amplitude-II-simplify}) the initial polarization $\bm{e} _{\rm{p}}$ of the incoming radiation need to be fixed.

Before doing so, a shorter notation is introduced where the transitions $M _{\rm{g}} \leftrightarrow M _{\rm{e}}$ are labeled by
\begin{align}
\ell=3 \qquad \text{--}& \qquad 1/2 \leftrightarrow 3/2\ , \nonumber \\
\ell=2 \qquad \text{--}& \qquad 1/2 \leftrightarrow 1/2\ , \nonumber \\
\ell=1 \qquad \text{--}& \qquad 1/2 \leftrightarrow -1/2\ , \nonumber \\
\ell=-1 \qquad \text{--}& \qquad -\!1/2 \leftrightarrow 1/2\ , \nonumber \\
\ell=-2 \qquad \text{--}& \qquad -\!1/2 \leftrightarrow -1/2\ , \nonumber \\
\ell=-3 \qquad \text{--}& \qquad -\!1/2 \leftrightarrow -3/2\ . 
\label{eq:l-notation}
\end{align}
%
%\begin{table}[h]

%
Within this notation, $\Delta M=0$ and $\Delta M=\pm1$ correspond to the even and odd $\ell$, respectively, where the relationship $\Omega_{\ell} = -\Omega_{-\ell}$ is fulfilled [compare Eq.~(\ref{eq:NFS_omegal})].


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
\subsubsection{Initially $\sigma$-polarized x-rays}



In the case of initially $\sigma$-polarized x-rays, only the $\Delta M=0$ transitions are driven initially due to $\mathcal{M}1$ selection rules (see Fig.~\ref{fig:current-redistribution}). Mathematically, the selection rules are enforced by the scalar product $\bm{j}_{\ell',\mathrm{I}}^{*} \cdot \bm{e} _{\rm{p}}$ which in the considered geometry ($\bm{B}_{\rm{I}} \parallel \bm{e}_{\rm{z}}$ and $\bm{e}_{\rm{p}} = \bm{e}_{\sigma}$) is only non-vanishing for even $\ell'$. Therefore, the summation over $\ell'$ occurring in Eq.~(\ref{eq:amplitude-II-simplify}) reduces to $\ell'=\pm2$. Moreover, using Eqs.~(\ref{eq:NFS_trans-ampl-M1}) it can be shown that the transition amplitude $\bm{j}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$ points along $\bm{e}_{\pi}$ ($\bm{e}_{\sigma}$) for transitions of even (odd) $\ell$ (see App.~\ref{app:Voigt}) which determines the directionality of $\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$. Explicitly performing the summation over $\ell'$ leads to the following relation (see App.~\ref{app:Voigt})
%\begin{equation}
%\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}(\bm{k}) \propto \bm{j}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}(\bm{k}) \,\begin{cases} \,\sin( \Omega_2 \tau_0) & \quad\text{for even $\ell$} \\
% \,\cos( \Omega_2 \tau_0) & \quad\text{for odd $\ell$} \end{cases}.
%\end{equation}
%
%
\begin{equation}
\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}(\bm{k}) \propto \begin{cases} \,\sin( \Omega_2 \tau_0) \, \bm{e}_{\pi} & \text{for even $\ell$}\ , \\
 \,\cos( \Omega_2 \tau_0) \, \bm{e}_{\sigma} & \text{for odd $\ell$}\ . \end{cases}
\label{eq:amplitude-II-sigma}
\end{equation}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:ampl-x} the magnitudes of $\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$ are plotted for even and odd transitions in dependence of $\tau_0$ along with the unperturbed, first order NFS intensity spectrum $|\bm{E}^{(1)}(\xi,\tau)|^2$. In the graphs showing the amplitudes, the proportionality predicted in Eq.~(\ref{eq:amplitude-II-sigma}) can be clearly identified. Moreover, by comparing for instance the upper plot with the unperturbed intensity spectrum it can be seen that the time instants where the amplitudes for even $\ell$ vanish, coincide with the maxima of $|\bm{E}^{(1)}(\xi,\tau)|^2$, whereas in the case of odd $\ell$, the roots of $\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$ exactly agree with the minima of the intensity spectrum.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.679\linewidth]{pics/Voigt-90-spec-x_ideal.eps}
\caption{The magnitudes of $\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$ are shown in dependence of $\tau_0$ for even and odd $\ell$

along with the first order NFS intensity spectrum $|\bm{E}^{(1)}(\xi,\tau)|^2$ (middle graph). Initially $\sigma$-polarized x-rays and an effective target thickness of $\xi=10$ are considered. In the case of even $\ell$, the zero crossings of $\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$ correspond to maxima of the spectrum, whereas in the case of odd $\ell$, the amplitudes $\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$ identically vanish at time instants corresponding to minima of $|\bm{E}^{(1)}(\xi,\tau)|^2$.}
\label{fig:ampl-x}
\end{figure}

By inserting the amplitudes of Eq.~\eqref{eq:amplitude-II-sigma} into Eq.~\eqref{eq:field-II} the first order solution of the scattered radiation field after magnetic field switching is obtained,
%
\begin{align}
\bm{E}^{(1)}(\xi,\tau) &\propto -\xi \Bigl\{ \sin(\Omega_2 \tau_0) \sin(\Omega_2 (\tau-\tau_0)) \bm{e}_{\pi} \nonumber \\
&\qquad
  +  \frac{1}{2} \cos(\Omega_2 \tau_0) \left[ \cos(\Omega_1(\tau-\tau_0)) + 3\cos(\Omega_3(\tau-\tau_0)) \right] \bm{e}_{\sigma} \Bigr\}\ .
\label{eq:field-II-sigma}
\end{align}
%
It can be seen that after rotation of the B-field the emission via an even transition ($\ell=\pm2$) results in $\pi$-polarized light whereas the odd transitions ($\ell=\pm1,\pm3$) determine the $\sigma$-polarized component.

Accordingly, switching at $\tau_0=(2 n+1)\, \frac{\pi}{2}/\Omega_2$ ($n=0,1,2,\dots$) corresponding to the roots of $\cos( \Omega_2 \tau_0)$ or the minima of the unperturbed NFS spectrum results in a amplitude $\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$ which is only non-vanishing for even $\ell$. In this case, the odd transitions interfere destructively due to the timed rotation of the magnetic field and hence, the initially $\sigma$-polarized radiation is emitted as $\pi$-polarized after the magnetic field rotation as graphically illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:current-redistribution}. This kind of switching scheme which converts linearly orthogonal polarizations into each other has already been experimentally verified in Ref.~\cite{Shvydko1996.PRL}. 

In contrast, a rotation of the magnetic field at the maxima $\tau_0=n\,2\pi/\Omega_2$ ($n=0,1,2,\dots$) corresponding to the roots of $\sin( \Omega_2 \tau_0)$ leads to destructive interference among the even transitions (see Fig.~\ref{fig:ampl-x}). In this case the reemission of the initially driven $\Delta M=0$ currents is transferred to the $\Delta M=\pm1$ hyperfine transitions due to the timed redistribution of the nuclear excitation. Subsequently, the scattered radiation field after B-field switching remains $\sigma$-polarized but is processed via the odd transitions in the new basis due to the destructive interference of terms with even $\ell$.

Fig.~\ref{fig:spec-x} exemplarily demonstrates the effect of the magnetic field rotation on the scattered radiation field. In the left graph the NFS intensity spectrum is plotted in first order for a B-field switching at $\tau_0=54.7$~ns (red dashed line) which corresponds to a minimum of the unperturbed spectrum. It can be seen that the initially $\sigma$-polarized light is converted to $\pi$-polarized light for times larger than $\tau_0$ with a reduction factor of $1/2$ in comparison to the unperturbed spectrum before switching. Moreover, the quantum beat period before and after switching remains unchanged since $\bm{E}^{(1)}$ given in Eq.~(\ref{eq:field-II-sigma}) is completely determined by the initially driven $\Delta M=0$ currents. For a switching at a maximum of the unperturbed spectrum (e.g. $\tau_0=31.6$~ns in the right graph of Fig.~\ref{fig:spec-x}) the polarization before and after the magnetic field rotation is conserved whereas the quantum beat period changes because the absorption via $\Delta M=0$ at $\tau=0$ is reemitted via the $\Delta M=\pm1$ transitions for $\tau>\tau_0$.

In the following the most important aspects of NFS under a 90$^{\circ}$ magnetic field rotation from $z$ to $x$ for initially $\sigma$-polarized x-rays are summarized:
\begin{itemize}
\item switching at zero crossings of odd $\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$: $\tau_0=(2 n+1)\, \frac{\pi}{2}/\Omega_2$
  \begin{itemize}
  \item correspond to \textbf{minima} of unperturbed spectrum
  \item $\sigma$-polarized x-rays are converted to $\pi$-polarized for $\tau>\tau_0$
  \item $\Delta M=\pm1$ interfere destructively for $\tau>\tau_0$
  \item NFS spectrum (before and after switching) determined by $\Delta M=0$ transitions
  \item absorption from even $\ell$, reemission via even $\ell$
  \end{itemize}
\item switching at zero crossings of even $\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$: $\tau_0=n\,2\pi/\Omega_2$
  \begin{itemize}
  \item correspond to \textbf{maxima} of unperturbed spectrum
  \item $\sigma$-polarization is conserved due to the B-field rotation
  \item $\Delta M=0$ interfere destructively for $\tau>\tau_0$
  \item NFS spectrum (after switching) determined by $\Delta M=\pm1$ transitions
  \item absorption from even $\ell$, reemission via odd $\ell$
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Initially $\pi$-polarized x-rays}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{pics/Voigt-90-spec-z_ideal.eps}
\caption{The same composition as in Fig.~\ref{fig:ampl-x} for initially $\pi$-polarized x-rays. Here, the zero crossings of the amplitudes $\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$ with even $\ell$ coincide with minima of $|\bm{E}^{(1)}(\xi,\tau)|^2$, whereas the simultaneous zero crossings for all odd amplitudes fall on time instants corresponding to maxima of $|\bm{E}^{(1)}(\xi,\tau)|^2$.}
\label{fig:ampl-z}
\end{figure}

Following the same lines as for initially $\sigma$-polarized x-rays, the time independent amplitudes for incident $\pi$-polarization evaluate to
%
\begin{equation}
\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}(\bm{k}) \propto \begin{cases} \, \left[ \sin(\Omega_1 \tau_0) + 3 \sin(\Omega_3 \tau_0) \right] \, \bm{e}_{\sigma} & \text{for}\quad \ell=\pm1\ , \\
 \, \left[ \cos(\Omega_1 \tau_0) + 3 \cos(\Omega_3 \tau_0) \right] \, \bm{e}_{\pi} & \text{for}\quad \ell=\pm2\ , \\ 
 \, \left[ \sin(\Omega_1 \tau_0) - \sin(\Omega_3 \tau_0) \right] \, \bm{e}_{\sigma} & \text{for}\quad \ell=\pm3\ . \end{cases}
\label{eq:amplitude-II-pi}
\end{equation}
%
Here, the amplitudes are given by a superposition of sine and cosine functions with frequencies $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_3$ (belonging to the initially driven $\Delta M=\pm1$ transitions). In Fig.~\ref{fig:ampl-z} the amplitudes for even and odd $\ell$ are plotted together with the unperturbed NFS intensity spectrum $|\bm{E}^{(1)}(\xi,\tau)|^2$ analogously as in the case of initial $\sigma$ polarization. As seen from the figure, the roots of $\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell=\pm2,\mathrm{II}}$ coincide with the minima of the unperturbed spectrum. For the odd transitions it is much more difficult to find time instants where all amplitudes vanish at once. Nevertheless, the simultaneous roots of $\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell=\pm1,\mathrm{II}}$ and $\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell=\pm3,\mathrm{II}}$ exactly correspond to local maxima of the unperturbed, first order spectrum. However, in the case of initially $\pi$-polarized radiation the maxima of the spectrum need not to be zero points of the amplitudes.

Analogously to the case of initially $\sigma$-polarized x-rays, the amplitudes defined in Eq.~\eqref{eq:amplitude-II-pi} can be inserted into Eq.~\eqref{eq:field-II} in order to obtain an expression for the scattered radiation field in first order after magnetic switching. Since it is exactly the same procedure we restrict ourselves to presenting only the most important features:
\begin{itemize}
\item switching at zero crossings of even $\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item correspond to \textbf{minima} of unperturbed spectrum
  \item $\pi$-polarized x-rays are converted to $\sigma$-polarized for $\tau>\tau_0$
  \item $\Delta M=0$ interfere destructively for $\tau>\tau_0$
  \item NFS spectrum (before and after switching) determined by $\Delta M=\pm1$ transitions
  \item absorption from odd $\ell$, reemission via odd $\ell$
  \end{itemize}
\item switching at zero crossings of odd $\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$
  \begin{itemize}
  \item correspond to \textbf{maxima} of unperturbed spectrum, but not all maxima are valid switching times
  \item $\pi$-polarization is conserved due to the B-field rotation
  \item $\Delta M=\pm1$ interfere destructively for $\tau>\tau_0$
  \item NFS spectrum (after switching) determined by $\Delta M=0$ transitions
  \item absorption from odd $\ell$, reemission via even $\ell$
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Effect of multiple scattering}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{pics/Voigt-90-switch-x_min.eps}
\caption{Effect of multiple scattering events. NFS intensity spectra $|\bm{E}(\xi,\tau)|^2$ with $p_{\rm{max}}=14$ are shown for $\xi=1$, $\xi=5$, $\xi=8$, $\xi=10$, $\xi=12$ and $\xi=15$. A fixed switching moment of $\tau_0=54.7$~ns has been chosen corresponding to a minimum of unperturbed, first order spectrum. The incident radiation has been assumed to be $\sigma$-polarized. The color coding follows Fig.~\ref{fig:spec-x}.}
\label{fig:min-xi-x}
\end{figure}

The moments of switching determined via Eq.~\eqref{eq:amplitude-II} give full control over the first order scattering solution $\bm{E}^{(1)}$ involving only single scattering events. In particular for thin samples and small interaction times where the probability of multiple absorption and reemission events is strongly suppressed, $\bm{E}^{(1)}$ represents the dominant contribution to the NFS intensity spectrum. Hence, using $\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$ for the determination of $\tau_0$ is sufficient to control the collective nuclear polarization response in the limit of thin targets and small times. The effect of multiple scattering contributions in dependence of the effective target thickness $\xi$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:min-xi-x}. We have exemplarily chosen a fixed moment of switching $\tau_0=54.7$~ns which according to Eq.~\eqref{eq:field-II} converts initially $\sigma$-polarized x-ray photons into $\pi$-polarized states. In the cases of $\xi=1$, $\xi=5$ and $\xi=8$ this behavior is clearly confirmed in Fig.~\ref{fig:min-xi-x}. Increasing the target thickness further, leads to higher and higher distortions from the ``wrong'' polarization component due to multiple scattering effects not accounted for in Eq.~\eqref{eq:field-II}. For instance, the relative contribution of the $\sigma$-polarized component after magnetic field rotation is more than doubled (3.4\% to 7.2\%) by going from from $\xi=10$ to $\xi=12$. At the latest starting with $\xi=15$ (total distortion of around 14\% after $\tau_0$), the sole dominance of the first order $\bm{E}^{(1)}$ seems to break down and multiple scattering events start to play a distinct role, giving rise to scattered radiation of the ``wrong'' polarization, in particular immediately after the magnetic field rotation. 

Note that the parameter regime of $\xi$ where the first order polarization control is applicable, is also slightly dependent on the moment of switching $\tau_0$. For instance, in the case of $\tau_0=54.7$~ns the polarization conversion works better for $\xi=8$ in comparison to the smaller thickness of $\xi=5$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:min-xi-x}). The reason is that $\tau_0=54.7$~ns is close to a minimum of the dynamical beat modulation for $\xi=8$. Moving $\tau_0$ to an earlier time, e.g. $\tau_0=39.1$~ns, clearly re-establishes the general trend of higher distortions in the case of thicker targets.

\section{Control beyond the single scattering approximation}
\label{sec:beyond-first-order}


Eq.~\eqref{eq:field-II} describes the scattered radiation field in first order where only single scattering events are taken into account. As we have seen in the previous section, the first order is the dominant order in the limit of thin targets and small interaction times. Consequently, the choice of $\tau_0$ based on Eq.~\eqref{eq:amplitude-II} is sufficient to dynamically control the polarization response of nuclear targets with small $\xi$. However, when applying timed rotations of the magnetic field for thicker targets, multiple scattering effects lead to distortions of the polarization purity already at effective target thicknesses larger than $\xi=10$. This raises the question whether it is possible to have polarization control beyond the first scattering order, corresponding to a more accurate choice of $\tau_0$.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{pics/amplitudes_multiple-scattering.pdf}
\caption{Decomposition of the scattered radiation field into contributions determined by the number of absorption events at times after the moment of magnetic field switching. The cases $\bm{E}_0$ and $\bm{E}_1$ are exemplarily shown corresponding to exactly 0 and 1 absorption events for $\tau>\tau_0$, respectively.}
\label{fig:beyond-first-order}
\end{figure}

To accomplish that, the total electric field given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:NFS_scattering-ampl} has to be rewritten as a sum of multiple scattering amplitudes
%
\begin{equation}
\bm{E}(\xi,\tau) = \bm{E}_0(\xi,\tau) + \bm{E}_1(\xi,\tau) + \bm{E}_2(\xi,\tau) + \dots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \bm{E}_n(\xi,\tau)\ ,
\label{eq:field-beyond}
\end{equation}
%
where $\bm{E}_n$ describes the contribution to the scattered radiation field with exactly $n$ absorption events for times $\tau>\tau_0$. This kind of decomposition is illustratively sketched in Fig.~\ref{fig:beyond-first-order} for $\bm{E}_0$ and $\bm{E}_1$. We will show in the following that each term $\bm{E}_n$ can be written as a product of a time-independent amplitude controllable via $\tau_0$ and some time-dependent factor, similar to Eq.~\eqref{eq:field-II}. In particular $\bm{E}_0$ shows exactly the same behavior given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:field-II} except that the time-independent amplitudes become regulated by the effective target thickness.

In the remaining part of this Chapter we assume $\tau>\tau_0$, since we are mainly concerned about the scattered field after the moment of switching. For $\tau<\tau_0$ the solution is again determined by Eq.~\eqref{eq:field-I}. The first step to decompose $\bm{E}$ into the form of Eq.~\eqref{eq:field-beyond} is to insert the recursion relation given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:NFS_scattering-ampl-solution} into the perturbation expansion \eqref{eq:NFS_scattering-ampl} leading to
%
\begin{equation}
\bm{E}(\xi,\tau) = \sum_{p=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-\xi)^p}{p!} \sum_{\ell} \bm{J}_{\ell}(\bm{k},\tau) \int_{0}^{\tau} \d\tau'\, \bm{J}_{\ell}^{*}(\bm{k},\tau') \cdot \bm{E}^{(p-1)}(\tau')\ .
\label{eq:field-beyond-1}
\end{equation}
%
In order to further evaluate Eq.~\eqref{eq:field-beyond-1}, the integration over $\tau'$ is split into two parts, an integral from 0 to $\tau_0$ and one from $\tau_0$ to $\tau$. This splitting allows us to make use of the explicit time dependence of $\bm{J}_{\ell}^{*}$ and $\bm{J}_{\ell}$ given by Eqs.~\eqref{eq:NFS_nucl-current-static} and \eqref{eq:NFS_nucl-current-rot} for the time sectors I ($\tau<\tau_0$) and II ($\tau>\tau_0$), respectively. We obtain
%
\begin{align}
\bm{E}(\xi,\tau) &= \sum_{p=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-\xi)^p}{p!} \sum_{\ell} \bm{J}_{\ell,\rm{II}}(\bm{k},\tau) 
 \nonumber \\
&\qquad \times
\Bigg( \int_{0}^{\tau_0} \d\tau'\, \bm{J}_{\ell,\rm{I}}^{*}(\bm{k},\tau') \cdot \bm{E}^{(p-1)}(\tau')
+ \int_{\tau_0}^{\tau} \d\tau'\, \bm{J}_{\ell,\rm{II}}^{*}(\bm{k},\tau') \cdot \bm{E}^{(p-1)}(\tau') \Bigg)\ .
\label{eq:field-beyond-2}
\end{align}
%
Let us have a closer look at the $(p-1)^{\rm{th}}$ scattering amplitude $\bm{E}^{(p-1)}$ occurring in Eq.~\eqref{eq:field-beyond-2}. In general, $\bm{E}^{(p-1)}$ can have multiple scattering contributions in both time regions, for times $\tau<\tau_0$ and for times $\tau>\tau_0$. For the further evaluation of the second integral it is helpful to divide $\bm{E}^{(p-1)}$ into a part where all the absorption events happen before the moment of switching, and a part with at least one absorption after $\tau_0$. For this kind of splitting we make again use of the recursive solution in Eq.~\eqref{eq:NFS_scattering-ampl-solution}. Successively expressing $\bm{E}^{(p-1)}$ in terms of $\bm{E}^{(p-2)}$, $\bm{E}^{(p-2)}$ in terms of $\bm{E}^{(p-3)}$, etc., and by dividing the occurring time integrations into the regions $\tau<\tau_0$ and $\tau>\tau_0$, we obtain

%

The part $\bm{E}_0$ with no absorption events after $\tau_0$ can be easily extracted from Eq.~\eqref{eq:field-beyond-3}. It evaluates to
%
\begin{align}
\bm{E}_0(\xi,\tau) &= \sum_{p=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-\xi)^p}{p!} \sum_{\ell} \bm{J}_{\ell,\rm{II}}(\bm{k},\tau)  \int_{0}^{\tau_0} \d\tau'\, \bm{J}_{\ell,\rm{I}}^{*}(\bm{k},\tau') \cdot \bm{E}^{(p-1)}(\tau')  \nonumber \\

\label{eq:field-beyond_0-1}
\end{align}
%
where we first changed the order of summations and afterwards renamed the summation index $p$ to $p+1$. Employing furthermore the explicit time dependence of $\bm{J}_{\ell,\rm{II}}$ given in Eqs.~\eqref{eq:NFS_nucl-current-rot}, we obtain the following form
%
\begin{equation}
\bm{E}_0(\xi,\tau) = \sum_{\ell} \bm{\mathcal{A}}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}(\bm{k},\xi) \, \e^{-\i \Omega_{\ell} (\tau - \tau_0) - \tau/2}\ ,
\label{eq:field-beyond_0}
\end{equation}
%
with the time-independent amplitude $\bm{\mathcal{A}}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$ given by
%
\begin{align}
\bm{\mathcal{A}}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}(\bm{k},\xi) &= \bm{j}_{\ell,\rm{II}}(\bm{k}) \sum_{\ell'} \e^{-\i \Omega_{\ell} \tau_0} \mathcal{D}_{M _{\rm{g}}M _{\rm{g}}'}^{I _{\rm{g}}}(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)  \nonumber \\
&\qquad \times
 \mathcal{D}_{M _{\rm{e}}M _{\rm{e}}'}^{I _{\rm{e}} \,*}(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)
 \Bigg( \int_{0}^{\tau_0} \d\tau'\, \bm{J}_{\ell',\mathrm{I}}^{*}(\bm{k},\tau') \cdot \sum_{p=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-\xi)^{p+1}}{(p+1)!} \bm{E}^{(p)}(\tau') \Bigg) \ .
\label{eq:amplitude-beyond_0}
\end{align}
%
In contrast to the first order amplitude $\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$ defined in Eq.~\eqref{eq:amplitude-II}, $\bm{\mathcal{A}}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$ depends on the effective target thickness $\xi$. However, it is possible to express $\bm{\mathcal{A}}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$ in terms of $\xi$-independent amplitudes $\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(p)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$ by explicitly writing the summation over the scattering orders $p$,
%
\begin{equation}
\bm{\mathcal{A}}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}(\bm{k},\xi) = -\frac{\xi}{1!} \bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}(\bm{k}) +  \frac{\xi^2}{2!} \bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(2)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}(\bm{k}) - \frac{\xi^3}{3!} \bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(3)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}(\bm{k}) \pm \dots = \sum_{p=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-\xi)^p}{p!} \bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(p)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}(\bm{k})\ ,
\label{eq:amplitude-beyond_0-decomp}
\end{equation}
%
with
%
\begin{align}
\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(p)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}(\bm{k}) &= \bm{j}_{\ell,\rm{II}}(\bm{k}) \sum_{\ell'} \e^{-\i \Omega_{\ell} \tau_0}  \mathcal{D}_{M _{\rm{g}}M _{\rm{g}}'}^{I _{\rm{g}}}(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)  \nonumber \\
&\qquad \times
\mathcal{D}_{M _{\rm{e}}M _{\rm{e}}'}^{I _{\rm{e}} \,*}(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)
 \Bigg( \int_{0}^{\tau_0} \d\tau'\, \bm{J}_{\ell',\mathrm{I}}^{*}(\bm{k},\tau') \cdot \bm{E}^{(p-1)}(\tau') \Bigg) \ .
\label{eq:amplitude-xi-independent}
\end{align}
%
This decomposition clearly proves that Eq.~\eqref{eq:field-beyond_0} describes the scattered field beyond first order. In the limit of small $\xi$, single scattering events dominate the nuclear scattering process such that $\bm{\mathcal{A}}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$ reduces to the first order amplitude $\bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$. In this case, the higher orders $p>1$ can be treated as small corrections. 

For large $\xi$, also higher orders in $\bm{E}_n$ gain in importance. These higher orders can be evaluated in the same manner like $\bm{E}_0$. For instance, in the case of exactly one absorption event after $\tau_0$, we obtain
%
\begin{align}
\bm{E}_1(\xi,\tau) &= \sum_{\ell} \bm{J}_{\ell,\rm{II}}(\bm{k},\tau)  \int_{\tau_0}^{\tau} \d\tau'\, \bm{J}_{\ell,\rm{II}}^{*}(\bm{k},\tau') \cdot \Bigg( \sum_{\ell'} \bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\ell',\mathrm{II}}(\bm{k},\xi) \, \e^{-\i \Omega_{\ell'} (\tau' - \tau_0) - \tau'/2} \Bigg)\ ,
%&= \sum_{\ell} \bm{J}_{\ell,\rm{II}}(\bm{k},\tau) \Bigg( \sum_{\ell'} \bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\ell',\mathrm{II}}(\bm{k},\xi) \cdot \int_{\tau_0}^{\tau} \d\tau' \bm{J}_{\ell,\rm{II}}^{*}(\bm{k},\tau')    \, \e^{-\i \Omega_{\ell'} (\tau' - \tau_0) - \tau'/2} \Bigg)\ .
\label{eq:field-beyond_1}
\end{align}
%
where the amplitudes $\bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$ can be written as
%
\begin{equation}
\bm{\mathcal{B}}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}(\bm{k},\xi) = \frac{\xi^2}{2!} \bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(1)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}(\bm{k}) - \frac{\xi^3}{3!} \bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(2)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}(\bm{k}) + \frac{\xi^4}{4!} \bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(3)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}(\bm{k}) \mp \dots = \sum_{p=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-\xi)^{p+1}}{(p+1)!} \bm{\mathcal{A}}^{(p)}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}(\bm{k})\ .
\label{eq:amplitude-beyond_1-decomp}
\end{equation}
%
As seen from Eqs.~\eqref{eq:field-beyond_1} and \eqref{eq:amplitude-beyond_1-decomp}, the magnetic field rotation at $\tau_0$ can only influence the nuclear response of excitations created earlier, in agreement with the principle of causality. Note that based on Eqs.~\eqref{eq:field-beyond_0} and \eqref{eq:field-beyond_1}, it is straightforward to generalize these results to the $n^{\rm{th}}$ order $\bm{E}_n$.

\caption{Polarization control beyond first order. Intensity spectra are shown analogously to Fig.~\ref{fig:min-xi-x}. The difference is that the switching moments (red dashed lines) are calculated beyond first order by numerically evaluating $\bm{\mathcal{A}}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$.

\label{fig:min-xi-x-beyond}
\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:min-xi-x-beyond}, numerical evaluated NFS intensity spectra $|\bm{E}(\xi,\tau)|^2$ including all scattering orders up to $p_{\rm{max}}=14$ are presented for effective target thicknesses $\xi=1$, $\xi=5$, $\xi=8$, $\xi=10$, $\xi=12$ and $\xi=15$. Analogously to Fig.~\ref{fig:min-xi-x}, a magnetic field switching is applied such that the incident $\sigma$-polarization is expected to be scattered into $\pi$-polarized states. In contrast to Fig.~\ref{fig:min-xi-x}, the moments of switching in Fig.~\ref{fig:min-xi-x-beyond} are chosen in dependence of the target thickness $\xi$ by numerically evaluating the amplitudes $\bm{\mathcal{A}}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$ given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:amplitude-beyond_0}. Comparing the polarization control beyond first order (Fig.~\ref{fig:min-xi-x-beyond}) with the first order results (Fig.~\ref{fig:min-xi-x}), it can be verified that the polarization purity after $\tau_0$ is strongly increased especially for large $\xi$. Regarding the integrated intensity for times larger than $\tau_0$, the distortions from the ``wrong'' polarization state could be optimized for all considered $\xi$ values to a relative contribution below 3.2\%. In particular for $\xi=15$, this corresponds to an improvement in the polarization purity by a factor of approximatively 4.5.
In the limit of thin samples, the moments of switching deviate only weakly from $\tau_0$ calculated via the first order approximation \eqref{eq:amplitude-II}. Increasing the target thickness leads to a larger and larger deviation, for instance, from $\xi=1$ to $\xi=15$ the discrepancy increases from 0.1~ns to 1.3~ns. Having a closer look at the case $\xi=15$ reveals that in particular immediately after the B-field rotation the purity of the polarization response is strongly enhanced in comparison to the first order result. At times much larger than $\tau_0$ distortions from higher orders $\bm{E}_n$ (absorption and reemission events after $\tau_0$) start to play a role not influenceable via the magnetic field rotation. Nevertheless, a switching moment determined by the amplitudes $\bm{\mathcal{A}}_{\ell,\mathrm{II}}$ (including all scattering events before $\tau_0$) is able to control the nuclear polarization response for targets up to $\xi=12$. For samples with $\xi \geq 15$, distortions from the ``wrong'' polarization are expected to become stronger due to stronger contributions from higher orders $\bm{E}_n$ with $n \neq 0$. In the limit of thin targets ($\xi \le 8$), the scattered radiation field seems to be well approximated by $\bm{E}_0$ such that the first order polarization control is sufficient.
