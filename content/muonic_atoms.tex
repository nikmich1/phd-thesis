\chapter{Hyperfine structure of muonic atoms}
\label{ch:muonic_atoms}
This chapter is devoted to the prediction of the level structure and transition probabilities in muonic atoms with focus on high nuclear charge numbers. Compared to conventional atomic electrons, the much higher muon mass reduces the length- and  increases the energy scales by the muon-electron mass ratio. Thereby, all finite nuclear size and shape effects are much more important and also excited nuclear states have to be taken into account.\\
This chapter is organized in the following way:\\
At first, a motivation for the need for new structure calculations is given in Section~\ref{sec:muon_motivation} by comparing to existing methods and by pointing new experiments in the field out, which use the results presented in this thesis.\\
Afterwards, the theoretical framework and implementation of several known effects is shown in Sections~\ref{sec:muon_framework} to~\ref{sec:muon_dynamic}, using finite basis set methods suitable for precision calculations and presenting results for selected nuclei.\\
In Sections~\ref{sec:muon_residualSO} and~\ref{sec:muon_quadUehl}, improved methods for calculating higher order effects in the electric hyperfine interactions are presented.\\
Finally, in Sections~\ref{sec:muon_re}, calculations in combination with experiments on isotopically pure Rhenium-185 are presented, including the extraction of the nuclear quadrupole moment by combining theoretical predictions and measurements of muonic transitions. \\
In Section~\ref{sec:muon_he}, precision calculations for the vacuum polarization corrections to the bound-muon $g$ factor in muonic Helium-4 are shown.

\section{Calculation of spectra for muonic atoms}
\subsection{Motivation}
\label{sec:muon_motivation}
Atomic nuclei are one of the building blocks of matter and therefore, information on their structure, like the distribution of electric charge inside the nucleus, is of intrinsic interest. Furthermore, the charge radii of atomic nuclei are of importance as an input parameter for the interpretation of other experiments. For example, radium atoms are a candidate for measuring atomic parity violation effects, but for this more accurate values of the radium charge radii are needed~\cite{wansbeek2012}.
There are several methods for extracting information on the nuclear charge distribution, i.e. the distribution of protons inside the atomic nucleus, like electron scattering~\cite{devries1987} or laser spectroscopy~\cite{wang2004,dewitte2007,mueller2007}. One method is also muonic atom spectroscopy. Here, a muon, which is a negatively charged elementary particle is brought in the proximity of an atomic nucleus. Then, the negatively charged muon forms bound states with the positively charged nucleus and radiation due to muonic transitions can be analyzed in order to obtain information on the nuclear charge distribution and measure quantities like nuclear charge radii and quadrupole moments.

Correspondingly, the theory of muonic atoms has been developed in order to describe the level structure and the probabilities for muonic transitions. The general approach is that for a given nuclear charge distribution, the spectrum of the corresponding muonic atom needs to be predicted. Then, vice versa, for a measured spectrum the nuclear charge distribution can be extracted. An overview of the different contributions to the energy levels of muonic atoms can be found in~\cite{BorieRinker1982}. Hitherto, the majority of analyses of the spectra of heavy muonic atoms used the computer programs \textit{MUON} and \textit{RURP}~\cite{rinker1979}. There are two main differences compared to the approach used in this thesis:
Firstly, the dual-kinetic-balance method~\cite{Shabaev2004} is used in this thesis. Being a finite basis set method, a approximation of the complete muon spectrum is obtained, i.e. bound states and positive as well as negative continuum states, including the effects of the finite nuclear charge distribution. Thereby, numerical summations over the complete muon spectrum are possible. This enables for example a complete treatment of the second order hyperfine interactions, as presented in Section~\ref{sec:muon_residualSO}.
Secondly, whereas in the \textit{MUON} and \textit{RURP} codes, the fine and hyperfine structure are calculated separately, in this thesis the calculations of the fine and hyperfine structure are performed at once, based on a given nuclear charge distribution, enabling improved analysis of the dependence of the muonic spectrum on parameters of the nuclear charge distribution.

Furthermore, there are new experiments on high $Z$ muonic atoms being performed by the muX-Collaboration at the Paul-Scherrer-Institute in Villigen, Switzerland~\cite{kirch2016}. One of the goals is to measure the charge radius for Radium, needed for experiments on atomic parity violations, as mentioned earlier in this Section. Furthermore, measurements on muonic atoms involving several nuclei will be or have been performed for the first time, involving isotopically pure Rhenium. The corresponding structure calculations for muonic Rhenium were performed during the work on this thesis, and results are presented in Section~\ref{sec:muon_re}.

\subsection{Theoretical framework}
\label{sec:muon_framework}
A muon is a charged elementary particle, which is in many aspects similar to the electron, in particular, it has the same electric charge, but it is ${\approx}\,{200}$ times heavier than the electron~\cite{codata}. When coming close to an atom, a muon can be captured by the nucleus and form a hydrogen-like muonic ion. This atomic system is commonly referred to as a muonic atom. The lifetime of the muon is big enough to be considered stable in the structure calculations of these muonic bound states.
The reason why muonic atoms, compared to conventional electronic atoms, are suitable for extraction information on nuclear structure is that the muon is about 207 times heavier than the electron. This can be seen by considering the ratio of the nuclear radius and the Bohr radius of the bound fermion, which is the typical length scale for the bound muon or electron. The larger this ratio is, the larger are nuclear finite size effects. The Bohr radius for a hydrogen-like atomic system with a bound fermion of mass $m_f$ and a nuclear charge number $Z$ reads as
\begin{equation}
r_B = \hbar / (m_f c Z \alpha),
\end{equation}
where $\hbar$ is the Planck's constant, $\alpha$ is the finestructure constant and $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum. In Table~\ref{tab:nucl_radii}, the nuclear radius, the Bohr radius for the corresponding electronic and muonic hydrogen-like ion, and their ratio is shown for a selection of nuclei, from very light to very heavy.

\caption{\label{tab:nucl_radii}
Comparison of the ratio of nuclear charge radius $R_N$ to the Bohr radius $r_B$ of a bound electron or muon in the corresponding hydrogen-like atomic system for Hydrogen, Helium, Rhenium, and Uranium. If this ratio is small, the finite size of the nucleus does not influence the bound fermion significantly. On the other hand, if this ratio is on the order of 1, large finite nuclear size and nuclear structure effects can be expected. The nuclear charge radii are taken from~\cite{Angeli2013}.}

It can be seen that, that for electronic atoms, the nucleus is generally a few orders of magnitude smaller compared to the extend of the electronic wave function, which is given by the Bohr radius, although for high $Z$, the electron is much closer to the nucleus due to the strong Coulomb attraction. Since the Bohr radius is inversely proportional to the mass of the bound fermion, the situation in muonic atomic systems is different. While for low $Z$, the extend of the muonic wave functions is still much larger than the nuclear radius, for high $Z$, the nuclear radius is actually larger than the muonic Bohr radius. This means the overlap between muonic wave functions and nucleus is large in this case. Also, a typical energy scale for hydrogen-like systems is the ground state binding energy from Eq.~\eqref{eq:finestructure_formula} for a point-like nucleus, which reads as
\begin{equation}
E_{0,\text{point}}=m_f c^2 (1-\sqrt{1-(Z\alpha)^2}),
\end{equation}
and is proportional the fermion mass. As a consequence, for muonic atoms and high charge numbers, muonic transitions can have an energy of several mega electronvolts and fine structure splitting can be on the order of several hundreds of kilo electronvolts. This is of the same order as excitation energies of nuclear rotational states~\cite{ENSDF} and therefore a nuclear model has to be used, which besides an extended charge distribution also contains the excited nuclear states of the ground state rotational band. Here, the symmetric rigid rotor model model for nuclei with axial symmetry has proved successful in describing heavy muonic atoms, e.g.~\cite{tanaka1984,hitlin1970,wu1969,Devons1995} and also is used in this thesis. The symmetric rigid rotor model is introduced in Appendix~\ref{app:rig_rotor}, where also the expressions for the nuclear wave functions in terms of Wigner D functions can be found. In the symmetric rigid rotor model, the nucleus is described by a charge distribution $\rho(\mathbf{r})$ given in the body fixed nuclear frame, and the Euler angles $\Omega=(\phi,\theta,\psi)$ describe its position in the laboratory frame. The rotational state of the nucleus $\left|IMK\right>$ is given by the total nuclear angular momentum quantum number $I$, its projection on the $z$ axis of the laboratory frame $M$ and on the $z$ axis of the body fixed frame $K$, where $K$ also corresponds to the ground state angular momentum. As derived in Chapter~\ref{ch:furry_pic}, the muonic bound states without radiative corrections can be obtained by solving the Dirac equation for the nuclear potential. The coupled system of muon as a Dirac particle and nucleus as a rigid rotor therefore is described by the eigenvalue equation
\begin{equation}
\text{H} \left(\left|N\right>\otimes \left|\mu\right>\right)= \left(\text{H}_{\text{N}} + \text{H}_\mu + V_{\text{el}}\right) \left(\left|N\right>\otimes \left|\mu\right>\right)= E \left(\left|N\right>\otimes \left|\mu\right>\right),
\label{eq:muon_htotal}
\end{equation}
where $H_{\text{N}}$ is the nuclear rigid rotor Hamiltonian, and ${H_\mu}{=}{\boldsymbol{\alpha} \cdot \mathbf{p} + \beta m_\mu}$ is the free Dirac Hamiltonian for the muon with momentum $\mathbf{p}$, and $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ and $\beta$ are the four Dirac matrices. $\left|N\right>$ is the nuclear state and $\left|\mu\right>$ is the muon state. Following Eq.~\eqref{eq:furry_elPot}, the electric potential energy between muon and nuclear charge distribution reads as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:muon_elInteract}
V_{\text{el}}(\mathbf{r}_\mu^\prime)=-Z\alpha \int \mathrm{d}^3\mathbf{r}_N^\prime \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r}_N^\prime)}{|\mathbf{r}_\mu^\prime-\mathbf{r}_N^\prime|}.
\end{equation}
It is important to recall, that the nuclear charge distribution is given in the body fixed nuclear frame, thus the integration in Eq.~\eqref{eq:muon_elInteract} in most conveniently performed in this frame. The resulting expression in dependence of the position of the muon, however, is needed in the laboratory frame. Therefore, in the following, a multipole expansion of Eq.~\eqref{eq:muon_elInteract} is performed, and the result is given as a function of the muon position in the laboratory frame and the Euler angles describing the orientation of the nuclear frame. Here, vectors are written is spherical components as $\mathbf{r}_i = (r_i,\vartheta_i,\varphi_i)$ in the laboratory frame and as $\mathbf{r}_i^\prime = (r_i^\prime,\vartheta_i^\prime,\varphi_i^\prime)$ in the body-fixed nuclear frame. Since rotations do not change the absolute value of rotations, it holds that $r_i^\prime = r_i$.\\

With the multipole expansion of the Coulomb potential~\cite{jackson1999}
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{|\mathbf{r}_\mu^{\,\prime}-\mathbf{r}_N^{\,\prime}|}=\sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{r_<^l}{r_>^{l+1}}\sum_{m=-l}^l  \text{C}^*_{lm}(\vartheta_N^{\prime},\varphi_N^{\prime})\text{C}_{lm}(\vartheta_\mu^\prime,\varphi_\mu^\prime),
\end{equation}
where $r_<:=\min (r_\mu,r_N)$, $r_>:=\max (r_\mu,r_N)$, the electric potential~\eqref{eq:muon_elInteract} can be written as
\begin{align}
V_{\text{el}}(\mathbf{r}_\mu^{\,\prime})=&\sum_{l,m}-Z\alpha \left[ \int \text{d}^3r^{\prime}_N \frac{r_<^l}{r_>^{l+1}}\text{C}^*_{lm}(\vartheta_N^{\prime},\varphi_N^{\prime})\rho(\mathbf{r}_N^{\,\prime})\right]\notag\\
&\,\times\text{C}_{lm}(\vartheta_\mu^{\prime},\varphi_\mu^\prime),
\end{align}
where ${\text{C}_{lm}(\vartheta,\varphi)}{=}{\sqrt{4\pi/(2l+1)}\text{Y}_{lm}(\vartheta,\varphi)}$ are the normalized spherical harmonics.
For axially symmetric charge distributions, only the ${m}{=}{0}$-terms are non-zero after integrating over the charge distribution. The dependency on the muonic angular variables can be transformed to the laboratory system using the Euler angles by
\begin{equation}
\text{P}_{l}(\cos\vartheta_\mu^\prime)=
 \sum_{m=-l}^l C^*_{lm}(\theta,\phi)C_{lm}(\vartheta_\mu,\varphi_\mu),
\end{equation}
which is a special case of Eq.~\eqref{eq:rot_sphHarm}.
Thereby, the potential as a function of the Euler angles and the muon's position in the laboratory frame reads
\begin{align}
V_{\text{el}}(\mathbf{r}_\mu,\phi,\theta)=&\sum_{l=0}^\infty-Z\alpha \left[ \int \text{d}^3\mathbf{r}^{\prime}_N \frac{r_<^l}{r_>^{l+1}}\text{P}_{l}(\cos \vartheta_N^{\prime})\rho(\mathbf{r}_N^{\,\prime})\right]\sum_{m=-l}^l \text{C}^*_{lm}(\theta,\phi)\text{C}_{lm}(\vartheta_\mu,\varphi_\mu).\notag\\
\eqqcolon &\sum_{l=0}^\infty Q_{\text{el}}^{(l)}(r_\mu)\sum_{m=-l}^lC^*_{lm}(\theta,\phi)C_{lm}(\vartheta_\mu,\varphi_\mu)&\notag\\
\eqqcolon& \sum_{l=0}^\infty V^{(l)}_{\text{el}}(\mathbf{r}_\mu,\phi,\theta),
\label{eq:defmulti}
\end{align}
where $Q_{\text{el}}^{(l)}(r_\mu)$ describe the radial distribution of the multipole moments and the dependency on the muonic angles and the Euler angles is in form of a scalar product of spherical tensor operators. This means, as expected the interaction energy does only depend on the relative orientation of the muon with respect to the body fixed nuclear $z^\prime$ axis.

Most nuclei turn out to be symmetric with respect to reflection in the $(x^\prime ,y^\prime)$-plane~\cite{zickendraht1991}. This results in only even-$l$ terms in Eq.~\eqref{eq:defmulti} being non-zero, thus the first to terms are the monopole term $l=0$ and the quadrupole term $l=2$. The next term would be the $l=4$ hexadecapole terms, however, usually, higher order terms are not needed for the correct description of the hyperfine level structure. It follows from Eq.~\eqref{eq:defmulti}, that the monopole terms only depends on the muonic radial variable, since it can be written as
\begin{equation}
V_{\text{el}}^{(0)}(r_\mu)=-Z\alpha \int\text{d}^3\mathbf{r}_N^\prime \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r}_N^\prime)}{r_>}.
\end{equation}
In fact, the $l=0$ terms is the averaged nuclear potential already derived in Eq.~\eqref{eq:gfac_monopole} in the previous chapter on the $g$ factor of spinless nuclei. As a consequence, the $l=0$-term can be used as a potential in the spherically symmetric Dirac equation to define the unperturbed muonic states as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:muonicEn}
\left(\boldsymbol{\alpha} \cdot \mathbf{p} + \beta m_\mu + V_{\text{el}}^{(0)}(r_\mu) \right) \left|n\kappa m\right> = E_{n\kappa}\left|n\kappa m\right>.
\end{equation}
The unperturbed nuclear states are the rigid rotor states from Eq.~\eqref{app:rigidRot_state} with
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:nuclEn}
\text{H}_N \left|IMK\right> = E_N \left|IMK\right>,
\end{equation}
where the excitation energies of the nuclear rotational states are typically taken from experiment~\cite{ENSDF}, and not parametrized by the moment of inertia from Eq.~\eqref{eq:rig_rotorEn}.
The $l=2$ quadrupole term couples nuclear and muonic degrees of freedom and is treated in perturbation theory in Sections~\ref{sec:elQuad1},~\ref{sec:muon_dynamic}, and~\ref{sec:muon_residualSO}. The multipole interaction from Eq.~\eqref{eq:defmulti} in general, and the quadrupole interaction with $l=2$ in particular has the structure of a scalar product of two irreducible tensor operators, as defined in Eq.~\eqref{app:tensor_scalarProd}. One operator acts on the nuclear angular variables, i.e. the Euler angles, and one on the muonic angular variables.
For these types of operators, the calculation of expectation values can be simplified by using the theory of irreducible tensor operators, as described in Appendix~\ref{app:ang_theo}. For applying formula~\eqref{app:reducedMatEl_expectation}. Therefore, states of defined total angular momentum have to be considered as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:totalState}
\left| FM\,IK\,n\kappa\right> = \sum_{M_N, m}\text{C}^{FM}_{IM_N\,j(\kappa)m}\left|IM_NK\right>\,\left|n\kappa m\right>
\end{equation}
with total angular momentum $F$, nuclear angular momentum $I$ and muonic angular momentum $j$ are defined. The muonic angular momentum $j$ is already composed out of the orbital angular momentum $l$ and the spin angular momentum, as described in Eq.~\eqref{eq:ansatz_dirac}. The total energy of the muon-nucleus system can be calculated as the sum of nuclear energy $E_N$ from Eq.~\eqref{eq:nuclEn}, the muonic energy from Eq.~\eqref{eq:muonicEn} and the expactation value of the quadrupole interaction $\left<V_{\text{el}}^{(2)}\right>$ from Eq.~\eqref{eq:defmulti}.

\subsection{Fine and first order hyperfine structure}
\label{sec:muon_finestructure}
In this Section, the solution of the Dirac equation for the muon will be discussed, in particular the effects of vacuum polarization in Uehling approximation, recoil corrections, electron screening are implemented, using known methods. Especially, the usage of the dual-kinetic-balance method~\cite{Shabaev2004} in the framework of muonic atoms is presented. In the following, the first order hyperfine structure is considered. Results are presented for muonic $^{205}$Bi, $^{147}$Sm, and $^{89}$Zr. This Section follows~\cite{michel2017}, which was published in the framework of this thesis.

\subsubsection{Finite nuclear size corrections}
\label{sec:radialEq}
%The total Hamiltonian for a muon bound to a nucleus can be written as a sum of nuclear, muonic, and interaction Hamiltonian~\cite{Devons1995}. Thus, we consider the Hamiltonian
%\begin{equation}
%H = H_{N} + H^{(0)}_{\mu} + H_{\mu - N},
%\end{equation}
%with the nuclear Hamiltonian $H_{N}$, the Dirac Hamiltonian $H^{(0)}_{\mu}$ for the free muon, and the interaction Hamiltonian $H_{\mu - N}$. The nucleus is described in the rotational model, i.e. in a state with well defined angular momentum and charge- and current density in the body fixed nuclear frame~\cite{kozhedub2008}. As a next step, the interaction between the bound muon and the atomic nucleus is expanded, where electric and magnetic interactions are taken into account. The interaction Hamiltonian is
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:Hint}
%H_{\mu - N} = H_{E} + H_{M}
%\end{equation}
%where the electric part reads
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:elInt}
%H_{E}= - \alpha \int \mathrm{d}V^{\prime}\, \frac{\rho (\mathbf{r}^{\,\prime})}{|\mathbf{r}_{\mu}-\mathbf{r}^{\,\prime}|} ,
%\end{equation}
%with the fine structure constant $\alpha$, the position $\mathbf{r}^{\,\prime}$ of the nuclear charge distribution and the position $\mathbf{r}_{\mu}^{\,\prime}$ of the muon in the nuclear frame. The nuclear charge distribution $\rho(\mathbf{r})$ is normalized to the nuclear charge $Z$ as
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:norm}
%\int \mathrm{d}V\rho(\mathbf{r}) = Z.
%\end{equation}
For considering monopole and quadrupole interactions, the nuclear charge distribution is divided into a spherically symmetric part $\rho_0(r)$ and a part $\rho_2(r)$ describing the quadrupole distribution in the nuclear frame as~\cite{hitlin1970}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:rho}
\rho(\mathbf{r}^{\,\prime}) = \rho_0(r^{\prime}) + \rho_2(r^{\prime}) \, Y_{20}(\vartheta^\prime,\varphi^\prime),
\end{equation}
with the spherical harmonics $Y_{lm}(\vartheta,\varphi)$. Since an analogous part for the dipole distribution would be an operator of odd parity, it would vanish after averaging with muon wave functions of defined parity~\cite{johnson2007}, and thus it is not considered here and neither are higher multipoles beyond the quadrupole term. Correspondingly, the electric potential from~\eqref{eq:defmulti} contains only the monopole and quadrupole part, and can be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:quadInt}
V_{\text{el}}(\mathbf{r}_\mu,\phi,\theta) = V^{(0)}_{\text{el}}(r_\mu) + V^{(2)}_{\text{el}}(\mathbf{r}_\mu,\phi,\theta),
\end{equation}
where the spherically symmetric part of the charge distribution can be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Hmonopole}
V^{(0)}_{\text{el}}(r_\mu)= - 4 \pi Z\alpha \int_0^\infty \mathrm{d}r \, r^2 \frac{\rho_0(r)}{r_>},
\end{equation}
with $r_>=\text{max}(r,r_\mu)$. This interaction potential will be included in the numerical solution of the Dirac equation for the muon as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:radialEq}. The quadrupole part of the interaction $V^{(2)}_{\text{el}}$ causes hyperfine splitting, which is calculated perturbatively in Sec.~\ref{sec:elQuad1}.\\

For evaluating these Hamiltonians, the appropriate states are states of defined total angular momentum, as introduced in Eq.~\eqref{eq:totalState}. As a basis for further calculations, the Dirac equation
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:diracSph}
\left( \boldsymbol{\alpha}\cdot \mathbf{p}+ \beta + V_{\text{el}}^{(0)}(r_\mu) \right) \ket{n \kappa m} = (1-E^{(B)}_{n \kappa}) \ket{n \kappa m}
\end{equation}
is solved for the muon. Here, $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ and $\beta$ are the four Dirac matrices, $E^{(B)}_{n \kappa}$ are the binding energies, and the potential $V(r)$ is the spherically symmetric part of the interaction with the nucleus, which is the monopole contribution from the electric interaction in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Hmonopole} and, if vacuum polarization is considered, the Uehling potential from Eq.~\eqref{eq:uehl_2}. A Fermi type charge distribution~\cite{Beier2000} is used to model the monopole charge distribution as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fermi}
\rho_0 (r)=\frac{N}{1+\text{exp}((r-c)/a)},
\end{equation}
where $a$ is a skin thickness parameter and $c$ the half-density radius. The normalization constant $N$ is chosen such that the volume integral is equal to one, since the charge is already included in the fine-structure constant. It has been proven, that $a=t/(4\,\text{log}3)$, with $t=2.30\,\text{fm}$, is a good approximation for most of the nuclei~\cite{Beier2000}. The parameter $c$ is then determined by demanding, that the charge radius squared
\begin{equation}
\left<r^2\right>=\cfrac{\int\text{d}r \, r^4\rho_0(r)}{\int\text{d}r \, r^2\rho_0(r)}
\end{equation}
agrees with the values from the literature~\cite{Angeli2013}. Since the potential in Eq.~\eqref{eq:diracSph} is spherically symmetric, the angular part can be separated and the solution with spherical spinors $\Omega_{\kappa m}(\vartheta,\varphi)$ can be written in terms of the spherical spinors from Eqs.~\eqref{eq:sph_spinor} and \eqref{eq:ansatz_dirac} as~\cite{greiner2000}
\begin{equation}
\ket{n\kappa m}=\frac{1}{r}\colvec{2}{G_{n\kappa}(r)\,\Omega_{\kappa m}}{i\,F_{n\kappa}(r)\,\Omega_{-\kappa m}},
\end{equation}
and the resulting equations for the radial functions are solved with the dual-kinetic-balance method~\cite{Shabaev2004} to obtain $G_{n\kappa}$ and $F_{n\kappa}$, and the corresponding eigenenergies numerically.

In Table~\ref{tab:sphDirac}, the binding energies for muonic $^{205}_{83}$Bi, $^{147}_{62}$Sm, and $^{89}_{40}$Zr are shown, both with and without the corrections from the Uehling potential in Eq.~\eqref{eq:uehl_2}. The finite nuclear size effect is illustrated by also including the binding energies $E^{(C)}_{n\kappa}$ from Eq.~\eqref{eq:finestructure_formula} of the pure Coulomb potential $-Z\alpha / r_\mu$, which read~\cite{greiner2000}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:finestructure_formula_2}
E^{(C)}_{n\kappa}=1-\left(1+\frac{(Z\alpha)^2}{\left( n-|\kappa|+\sqrt{\kappa^2-(Z\alpha)^2} \right)^2}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}.
\end{equation}
The uncertainties include the error in the rms radius value as well as a model error, which is estimated via the difference of the binding energies with the Fermi potential from Eq.~\eqref{eq:fermi} and the potential of a charged sphere with the same rms radius. For heavy nuclei, the finite nuclear size correction can amount up to 50$\,\%$, and thus the binding energy is halved.

\subsubsection{Vacuum polarization in Uehling approximation}
\label{sec:qed}

For atomic electrons, usually the self-energy QED correction is comparable to the vacuum polarization correction~\cite{Beier2000}. For muons, however, the vacuum polarization correction is much larger due to virtual electron-positron pairs, which are less suppressed due to their low mass compared to the muon's mass~\cite{BorieRinker1982}. The spherically symmetric part of the vacuum polarization to first order in $\alpha$ and $Z\alpha$ is the Uehling potential~\cite{Elizarov2005}
\begin{alignat}{2}
&V_{\text{Uehl}}(r_\mu)&&=-\alpha \frac{2\alpha}{3\pi}\int_0^\infty \text{d}r^{\prime}\,4\pi \rho_0(r^\prime)\int_1^\infty \text{d}t\,\left( 1+\frac{1}{2t^2} \right)\nonumber\\[7.5pt]
&&&\times\frac{\sqrt{t^2-1}}{t^2} \frac{\text{exp}(-2m_e|r_\mu-r^\prime|t)-\text{exp}(-2m_e(r_\mu+r^\prime)t)}{4m_er_\mu t},
\label{eq:uehl_2}
\end{alignat}
where $m_e$ is the electron mass and $\rho_0$ is the spherically symmetric part of the charge distribution from Eq.~\eqref{eq:rho}. This potential can be directly added to the Dirac equation \eqref{eq:diracSph}. In this way, all iterations of the Uehling potential are included~\cite{indelicato2013}. Results for our calculations can be found in Table~\ref{tab:sphDirac}.

\subsubsection{Recoil corrections}
\label{sec:recoil}
Taking into account the finite mass and the resulting motion of the nucleus leads to recoil corrections to the bound muon energy levels. In nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, as in classical mechanics, the problem of describing two interacting particles can be reduced to a one particle problem by using the reduced mass $m_r$ of the muon-nucleus system~\cite{landaulifshitz3}. With the mass of the nucleus $m_N$, the reduced mass reads in the chosen system of units as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:redmass}
m_r=\frac{m_N}{m_N+1},
\end{equation}
and the Dirac equation is accordingly modified to
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:diracSphRed}
\left( \boldsymbol{\alpha}\cdot \mathbf{p}+ \beta\,m_r + V_{\text{el}}^{(0)}(r_\mu) \right) \ket{n \kappa m} = (m_r-E^{(B)}_{n \kappa}) \ket{n \kappa m}.
\end{equation}
In relativistic quantum mechanics, this separation is not possible. We follow an approach used in Refs.~\cite{friar1973,BorieRinker1982}, which includes the nonrelativistic part of the recoil correction already in the wave functions by using the reduced mass in the Dirac equation and calculating the leading relativistic corrections perturbatively. If $E^{\text{(fm)}}_{n\kappa}$ denotes the binding energy of Eq.\eqref{eq:diracSph} with the finite size potential from Eq.~\eqref{eq:Hmonopole} but with the reduced mass replaced by the full muon rest mass, and $E^{\text{(rm)}}_{n\kappa}$ the binding energy in the same potential but with the reduced mass from Eq.~\eqref{eq:redmass}, then the leading relativistic recoil correction $\Delta E^{\text{(rec,rel)}}_{n\kappa}$ according to Ref.~\cite{BorieRinker1982} reads
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:relrec}
\Delta E^{\text{(rec,rel)}}_{n\kappa} = -\frac{\left(E^{\text{(fm)}}_{n\kappa}\right)^2}{2 M_N}+\frac{1}{2 M_N}\left< h(r) + 2 E^{\text{(fm)}}_{n\kappa} P_1(r)  \right>,
\end{equation}
where $M_N$ is the mass of the nucleus, and the functions $h(r)$ and $P_1(r)$ are defined in Eqs. (109) and (111) of Ref.~\cite{BorieRinker1982}, respectively. In Table~\ref{tab:recoil}, the binding energies obtained from solving the Dirac equation with the muon rest mass and the reduced mass of the muon-nucleus system are compared, and the leading relativistic recoil correction is shown. The uncertainties include errors in the rms radius, the model of the charge distribution and for the relativistic recoil, and a $(m_\mu/M_N)^2$ term due to higher-order corrections in the mass ratio of muon and nucleus, which dominates the uncertainty for lower $Z$.

\caption{\label{tab:recoil}Recoil corrections to the binding energies of the muon. fm (full mass) denotes the finite size binding energy, analogous to the fourth column of Table~\ref{tab:sphDirac}, but with the rest mass of the muon used in the Dirac equation. $\Delta E_{\text{rec,nr}}$ is the non-relativistic recoil correction, which is the difference between the finite size Dirac solutions with reduced mass and full mass, respectively. $\Delta E^{\text{(rec,rel)}}_{n\kappa}$ is the leading relativistic recoil correction from Section~\ref{sec:recoil}.

The effect of the surrounding electrons on the binding energies of the muon was estimated following Ref.~\cite{vogel1973} by calculating an effective screening potential from the charge distribution of the electrons as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:screenPot}
V_{e}(\mathbf{r}_\mu)=-\alpha \int \mathrm{d}V\frac{\rho_e (\mathbf{r})}{|\mathbf{r}_\mu-\mathbf{r}|},
\end{equation}
and using this potential in the Dirac equation for the muon. The charge distribution of the electrons is obtained by their Dirac wave functions as $\rho_e (\mathbf{r})=\sum_i \psi_{e_i}^*(\mathbf{r})\cdot \psi_{e_i}(\mathbf{r})$, where $\psi_{e_i}(\mathbf{r})$  is the four component spinor of the $i$-th considered electron. In order to obtain the wave functions of the electrons, it has to be taken into account, that the muon essentially screens one unit of charge from the nucleus. The simplest possibility is to replace the nuclear charge by an effective charge $\tilde{Z}=Z-1$ and then solve the Dirac equation for the electron with this modified nuclear potential. Another possibility is to start solving the Dirac equation for the muon in the nuclear potential without electron screening. Then, the Dirac equation for the electron is solved for all required states, adding the screening potential due to the bound muon
\begin{equation}
V_{\mu}(\mathbf{r}_e)=-\alpha \int \mathrm{d}V\frac{\psi_\mu^*(\mathbf{r})\cdot \psi_\mu(\mathbf{r})}{|\mathbf{r}_e-\mathbf{r}|},
\end{equation}
analogously to Eq.~\eqref{eq:screenPot}.
The interaction between the electrons is not taken into account here. Finally, the Dirac equation for the muon is solved again, now including the nuclear potential and the screening potential \eqref{eq:screenPot} due the atomic electrons from the considered electron configuration. This procedure can be repeated in the spirit of Hartree's method~\cite{bethe_salpeter} until the electrons and the muon are self-consistent in the fields of each other, but our studies show that one iteration is usually enough since the overlap of muon and electron wave functions in heavy muonic atoms is small. It is important to note, that here the screening potential depends to a small extent on the state of the muon, since the muon wave function is used in the calculation for the electron wave function. The atomic electrons primarily behave like a charged shell around the muon and the nucleus; thus every muon level is mainly shifted by a constant term, which is not observable in muonic transitions. The screening correction $\Delta E_S$ is defined as the difference of the binding energy without screening potential and with screening potential, therefore a positive value indicates that the muon is less bound due to the screening effect. The main contribution to the nonconstant part of the screening potential comes from the 1$s$ electrons, since their wave functions have the biggest overlap with the muon; therefore the exact electron configuration has only a minor effect on transition energies~\cite{vogel1973}. In Table~\ref{tab:screen}, results for the screening correction are shown for both mentioned methods and for different electron configurations. Values of the screening correction for different electron configurations show that a 10\% error for the non-constant part is a reasonable estimate.

Since for heavy nuclei the nuclear radius is comparable to the muon's Compton wavelength~\cite{Angeli2013,codata}, the muonic wavefunction overlaps strongly with the nucleus and the muon is sensitive to nuclear shape corrections, which results in hyperfine splitting of the energy levels. The quadrupole part of the electric interaction \eqref{eq:quadInt} can be rewritten as~\cite{kozhedub2008}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Hquad}
V^{(2)}_{\text{el}}(\mathbf{r}_\mu,\theta,\phi) = - \alpha \frac{Q_0 F_{\text{QD}}(r_\mu)}{2\, r_\mu^3} \sum_{m=-2}^2 C_{2m}(\theta,\phi)C_{2m}^{*}(\vartheta_\mu,\varphi_\mu),
\end{equation}
where $C_{lm}(\vartheta,\varphi)=\sqrt{4\pi/(2l+1)}Y_{lm}(\vartheta,\varphi)$ and angles with a subscript $\mu$ describe the position of the muon in the laboratory frame. Here, the nuclear intrinsic quadrupole moment is defined via the charge distribution from Eq.~\eqref{eq:rho} as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:defQ0}
Q_0 = 2 \sqrt{\frac{4\pi}{5}} \int_0^\infty r^4 \rho_2(r)\,\mathrm{d}r,
\end{equation}
and the distribution of the quadrupole moment is described by the function $f(r_\mu)$, where in the point-like limit $f(r_\mu)=1/r_\mu^{-3}$. For the shell model, where the quadrupole distribution is concentrated around the nuclear rms radius $R_N$, the divergence for $r_\mu=0$ is removed, and the corresponding quadrupole distribution function is
\begin{equation}
F_{\text{QD}}(r_\mu)=
\begin{cases}
\left(\nicefrac{r_\mu}{R_N}\right)^5 & r_\mu \leq R_N\\
1 &r_\mu > R_N
\end{cases}.
\end{equation}
Formally, this corresponds to a charge distribution with
\begin{equation}
\rho_2(r_\mu)=\frac{Q_0}{2 R_N^4}\sqrt{\frac{5}{4\pi}}\delta(r_\mu-R_N).
\end{equation}
The matrix elements of the quadrupole interaction from Eq.~\eqref{eq:Hquad} in the states~\eqref{eq:totalState} read~\cite{Korzinin2005}
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{l}
\label{eq:hquad}
\bra{FM_FI\kappa}H^{(2)}_E\ket{FM_FI\kappa}= - \alpha (-1)^{j+I+F}\\
\qquad\quad\times \bra{I|}\frac{Q_0}{2} \widehat{C}_2(\vartheta_N,\varphi_N)\ket{|I}
\bra{n\kappa|}\frac{F_{\text{QD}}(r_\mu)}{r_\mu^{3}}\widehat{C}_2(\vartheta_\mu,\varphi_\mu)\ket{|n\kappa}\nonumber.
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
The reduced matrix element in the nuclear coordinates can be expressed with the spectroscopic nuclear quadrupole moment $Q$ as
\begin{equation}
\nonumber
\bra{I|}\frac{Q_0}{2} \widehat{C}_2(\vartheta_N,\varphi_N)\ket{|I}= Q\sqrt{\frac{(2I+3)(2I+1)(I+1)}{4I(2I-1)}},
\end{equation}
and the reduced matrix elements in the muonic coordinates are
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{l}
\bra{n\kappa|}f(r_\mu)\widehat{C}_2(\vartheta_\mu,\varphi_\mu)\ket{|n\kappa} =\\[5pt]
\quad-\sqrt{\frac{(2j+3)(2j+1)(2j-1)}{16j(j+1)}}
\int_0^\infty \left( G^2_{n\kappa}(r_\mu)+F^2_{n\kappa}(r_\mu)\right)\frac{F_{\text{QD}}(r_\mu)}{r_\mu^{3}} \mathrm{d}r_\mu.\nonumber
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
The values for the nuclear rms-radii $R_N$ and the spectroscopic quadrupole moments $Q$ are taken from Refs.~\cite{Angeli2013,Stone2005}. In Table~\ref{tab:hfs}, results for the electric quadrupole hyperfine splitting for the nuclei $^{205}_{83}$Bi, $^{147}_{62}$Sm, and $^{89}_{40}$Zr are shown for a selection of hyperfine states, including uncertainties stemming from the error in the quadrupole moment and an estimation of the modeling uncertainty.

\subsubsection{Magnetic dipole splitting}
\label{sec:magndip}
As for the magnetic part, dipole interaction is considered. Therefore, the corresponding interaction Hamiltonian reads~\cite{Elizarov2005}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Hmag}
H_{M} = \frac{|e|}{4 \pi}\,\boldsymbol{\mu}\cdot \left( F_{\text{BW}}(r) \frac{\mathbf{r}}{r^3} \times \boldsymbol{\alpha} \right),
\end{equation}
with the charge of the muon $e=-|e|$, the nuclear magnetic moment $\boldsymbol{\mu}$, its distribution function $F_{\text{BW}}$, and the Dirac matrices $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$. If the nuclear current density is described by a normalized scalar function $f_\mu(r)$ as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:currentdistr}
\mathbf{j}(r)= \text{rot}\left(\boldsymbol{\mu}f_\mu(r)\right),
\end{equation}
then the distribution function is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Fbw}
F_{\text{BW}}(r)=-r^2 \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\,\int \text{d}V^{\prime}\,\frac{f_\mu(r^{\prime})}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}\,^{\prime}|}.
\end{equation}
The difference in the hyperfine splitting between a point-like magnetic moment and a spacial distribution of the magnetization is called the Bohr-Weisskopf effect~\cite{bohrWeisskopf1950}. In the following, the diagonal matrix elements of the magnetic interaction are analyzed, paying special attention to the distribution function $F_{\text{BW}}$. We expect the contribution of the higher-order terms, namely electric octupole, magnetic quadrupole, and beyond, to be smaller than the uncertainty of the considered terms~\cite{Devons1995,Steffen1985}. Therefore they can be ignored here.

The hyperfine splitting arises from the interaction of the nuclear magnetic moment with the muon's magnetic moment, which is also sensitive to the spatial distribution of the nuclear currents. Since the magnetic moment of the muon is inversely proportional to its mass, the magnetic hyperfine splitting in muonic atoms is less important than in electronic atoms. The matrix elements of the corresponding Hamiltonian~\eqref{eq:Hmag} in the state~\eqref{eq:totalState} are~\cite{Korzinin2005}
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{l}
\label{eq:hmag}
\bra{FM_FI\kappa}H_M\ket{FM_FI\kappa}=
\,\,\left[ F(F+1)-I(I+1)-j(j+1)\right] \\[7.5pt]
\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\,\,\times\frac{\alpha}{2 m_p}\frac{\mu}{\mu_N}\frac{\kappa}{Ij(j+1)}\int_0^\infty \frac{G_{n\kappa}(r_\mu)F_{n\kappa}(r_\mu)F_{\text{BW}}(r_\mu)}{r_\mu^2}\mathrm{d}r_\mu,\nonumber
\end{IEEEeqnarray}
where $m_p$ is the proton mass, and the ratio of the observed magnetic moment $\mu:=\bra{II}(\boldsymbol{\mu})_z\ket{II}$ and the nuclear magneton $\mu_N$ can be found in the literature~\cite{Stone2005}. For the simple model of a homogeneous nuclear current distribution the distribution function from Eq.~\eqref{eq:Fbw} of the Bohr-Weisskopf effect reads
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bwsimple}
F_{\rm{BW}}(r_\mu)=\begin{cases}
\left( \nicefrac{r_\mu}{R_N} \right)^3 & r_\mu \leq R_N\\
1 &r_\mu > R_N
\end{cases}.
\end{equation}
Furthermore, an additional method is used to obtain the distribution function $F_{\rm{BW}}$ from the nuclear single particle model, where the nuclear magnetic moment is assigned to the odd nucleon and the Schrödinger equation for this nucleon is solved in the Woods-Saxon potential of the other nucleons~\cite{Elizarov2005}. In Table~\ref{tab:hfs}, results for the magnetic dipole hyperfine splitting for the nuclei $^{205}_{83}$Bi, $^{147}_{62}$Sm, and $^{89}_{40}$Zr are presented for a selection of hyperfine states, using both methods for obtaining $F_{\rm{BW}}$, where the model error is estimated by the difference of these two methods and the uncertainty in the magnetic moment is also taken into account.

\subsection{Dynamic hyperfine structure}
\label{sec:muon_dynamic}
It turns out, that the first order calculation of the electric hyperfine structure due to the quadrupole interaction in heavy muonic atoms is not sufficient for the prediction of the level structure. There are two reasons for this:

Firstly, the fine-structure splitting between states of the same parity, especially between the $2p1/2$ and $2p3/2$ states, is on the energy scale of a few hundred kilo electronvolts. This can be seen for the example of $^{205}$Bi in Table~\ref{tab:sphDirac}. On the other hand, the first order energy correction due to the electric quadrupole interaction for $^{205}$Bi is also more than 100 keV in the $2p3/2$ states, as seen in Table~\ref{tab:hfs}. Note that the expectation value of the quadrupole interaction in the $2p1/2$ states vanishes because of angular momentum selection rules. The quadrupole interaction is a rank 2 tensor operator, thus the sum of the involved angular momenta must also be larger than or equal to 2. This is not the case for the expectation value in the $2p1/2$ states with $j=1/2$. There are, however, also the non-diagonal matrix elements with one $2p1/2$ and one $2p3/2$ states, which are also on the hundred keV states for high $Z$ muonic atoms. If the quadrupole hyperfine structure is only calculated in first order perturbation theory, these non-diagonal elements are not considered. Since the separation between the two unperturbed states ($2p1/2$ and $2p3/2$) is on the same level as the non-diagonal matrix elements, first order perturbation theory is not enough. As a consequence, the non-diagonal matrix elements have to be taken into account. One possibility would be using higher order perturbation theory, which involves a sum over the complete muonic spectrum. However, already the consideration of the non-diagonal matrix elements for a muonic fine-structure doublet can explain the majority of the higher order effects. Therefore, the formalism of (almost) degenerate perturbation theory~\cite{sakurai1994} is useful, and the general approach will be briefly reviewed in the following Section. Here, the quadrupole interaction is rediagonalized in finite-dimensional subspaces only using a small number of muonic states.

Secondly, the energy scale of the fine structure and electric quadrupole splitting on the order of hundred keV or more is on the same scale as the typical excitation energy of the excited nuclear states in the rotational ground state band. In addition, the nuclear states in the ground state rotational band have the same parity and thus are coupled by the quadrupole interaction. This means, the expectation value of the quadrupole operator is generally non-zero, also for the case of different nuclear rotational states. As a consequence, the excited nuclear states have to be taken into account when rediagonalizing the quadrupole interaction in finite-dimensional subspaces as discussed above.

\subsubsection{Almost-degenerate perturbation theory}
\label{sec:almostDeg}
In this Section, the general approach to almost-degenerate perturbation theory is briefly reviewed, following~\cite{BorieRinker1982,sakurai1994}, before it is applied to muonic atoms in the following sections. For simplicity, a system with unperturbed eigenstates $\left|n\right>$ and corresponding unperturbed energies $\mathcal{E}_n$ is investigated with the unperturbed eigenvalue equation
\begin{equation}
H_0 \left|n\right> = \mathcal{E}_n \left|n\right>,
\end{equation}
where $H_0$ is the unperturbed Hamiltonian.
The connection to the muonic atom case can be made by considering $n$ as a multi-index for all the quantum numbers $F,\,M,\,I,\,K,\,n,\,\kappa,\,m$ of the muonic atom and using the quadrupole interaction for the perturbation $H_1$. The perturbed eigenvalue equation reads
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pert_Htot}
\left(H_0 + H_1\right) \left|a\right> = E_a \left|a\right>.
\end{equation}
If $m$ different states $\left| n_i \right>$ are almost degenerate, which means their energy separation is on the same order as the first order correction due to $H_1$, the corresponding modelspace is defined as all $\left| n_i \right>$ with $i\in \{1,...,m\}$, if necessary the states have to be relabeled, such that the lowest indices correspond to the states defining the model space. The projector $\text{P}$ on the modelspace is defined by acting on an eigenstate $\left|a\right> = \sum_n a_n \left|n\right>$ of Eq.~\eqref{eq:pert_Htot} as
\begin{equation}
\text{P}\left|a\right> = \sum_{i=1}^m a_i \left|n_i\right>,
\end{equation}
thus keeping only the coefficients for states inside the modelspace. Analogously, the Projector $\text{Q}$ is defined as the complement, i.e. keeping only coefficients of states outside of the modelspace. Thereby, it holds that $\text{P}+\text{Q}=\mathbb{1}$ and the following relations~\cite{BorieRinker1982} can be derived for eigenstates of the total Hamiltonian from Eq.~\eqref{eq:pert_Htot}:
\begin{alignat}{2}
&\text{Q}\left|a\right> &&= - (H_0-E_a)^{-1}\text{Q}H_1 \left|a\right>\notag\\
 (H_0-E_a+\text{P}H_1)&\text{P}\left|a\right>&&= -\text{P}H_1\text{Q}\left|a\right>.
\end{alignat}
Combining these two equations results in
\begin{equation}
\text{P}\left( \,
(H_0-E_a+H_1)\text{P}\left|a\right>
- H_1(H_0-E_a)^{-1}\text{Q}H_1\left|a\right>
\right) = 0,
\label{eq:pert_projectionEq}
\end{equation}
which is suitable for an expansion in $\text{Q}$, so expansion in the consideration of states outside of the finite dimensional modelspace. The zero-order term is obtained by neglecting the term containing a $\text{Q}$ operator:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pert_firstOrder}
\text{P}\left(H_0+H_1-E_a\right) \text{P}\left|a\right> = 0.
\end{equation}
This is essentially Eq.~\eqref{eq:pert_Htot}, but projected onto the modelspace. As expected, to zeroth order the states outside of the modelspace can be neglected. Since this is a finite dimensional system, this corresponds to constructing the Hamiltonian matrix and diagonalizing it.

Applied to muonic atoms, the unperturbed Hamiltonian is the sum of rigid rotor Hamiltonian for the nucleus and Dirac Hamiltonian with the monopole potential for the muon, and the perturbation is the hyperfine (mainly quadrupole) interaction. Then a modelspace needs to be chosen, for example the first few nuclear rotational states and a muonic fine-structure doublet like the ($2p3/2$, $2p1/2$) or ($3d5/2$, $3d3/2$) states. Finally the diagonal and non-diagonal matrix elements of the hyperfine interactions need to be calculated for all states in the modelspace and the matrix representation of the total Hamiltonian in the modelspace needs to be diagonalized.

The solution of Eq.~\eqref{eq:pert_firstOrder} results in an approximation for the eigenstates of the full Hamiltonian as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pert_firstOrderState}
\left|a\right>\approx \left|a^{(0)}\right> = \sum_{i=1}^m a_i^{(0)}\left|n_i\right>,
\end{equation}
which is a linear combination of the unperturbed states forming the modelspace, with the coefficients obtained from the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix. The corresponding eigenvalues are the approximations $E_a^{(0)}$ of the eigenenergy.

For the leading order corrections due to the operator $\text{Q}$, Eq.~\eqref{eq:pert_projectionEq} is used, including the Q-dependent term, however, only the effect on the modelspace is investigated, corresponding to the approximation $\left|a\right> \approx \text{P}\left|a\right>$. Using the property of a projection operator $\text{P}^2=\text{P}$, Eq.~\eqref{eq:pert_projectionEq} can be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pert_secondOrder}
 \underbrace{\text{P}(H_0+H_1-E_a)\text{P}}_{\tilde{H}_0} + \underbrace{\text{P}(H_1(E_a-H_0)^{-1}\text{Q}H_1)\text{P}}_{\tilde{H}_1} \left|a\right> = 0,
\end{equation}
which takes the form of an eigenvalue problem with the unperturbed Hamiltonian $\tilde{H}_0$ and the perturbation $\tilde{H}_1$. Because of $\text{P}$ on the left and right side, this is a finite dimensional problem, although each matrix element of $\tilde{H}_1$ involves a summation over the complete spectrum, as shown below. The unperturbed solutions are already known from Eq.~\eqref{eq:pert_firstOrderState}, thereby the energy correction due to the perturbation $\tilde{H}_1$ can be calculated within first order perturbation theory as
\begin{alignat}{2}
\label{eq:pert_secondOrderEnerg}
&E_a^{(1)}&&= \left<a^{(0)} \middle| \tilde{H}_1 \middle| a^{(0)} \right>\\[7.5pt]
& &&= \sum_{k>m} \frac{\left<a^{(0)}\middle|H_1\middle|n_k\right>\left<n_k\middle|H_1\middle|a^{(0)}\right>}{E_a^{(0)}-\mathcal{E}_{n_k}}\\[7.5pt]
& &&= \sum_{i,j=1}^m a_i^{(0)\,*}a_j^{(0)} \sum_{k>m} \frac{\left<n_i\middle|H_1\middle|n_k\right>\left<n_k\middle|H_1\middle|n_j\right>}{E_a^{(0)}-\mathcal{E}_{n_k}}\notag,
\end{alignat}
where the projector on states outside of the modelspace is formally written as $\text{Q}=\sum_{k>m}\left|n_k\right>\left<n_k\right|$. If there are continuous parts in the spectrum, this sum also involves integrals. The meaning of Eq.~\eqref{eq:pert_secondOrderEnerg} is the following: Once the zero order energies and states are found by diagonalizing the Hamiltionian in the modelspace, the first order energy correction due to states outside of the modelspace is calculated by calculating the second order energy correction due to the original perturbation $H_1$, but the intermediate sum only involves states not contained in the modelspace, i.e. not already considered in the diagonalization. As a result, the sum $E_a\approx E_a^{(0)}+E_a^{(1)}$ contains a complete second order treatment of the perturbation $H_1$, and additionally the contributions of the states in the modelspace to all orders.

For actual calculations in the context of muonic atoms, these calculations turn out to be expensive for the following reasons: Already the unperturbed Hamiltonian involves a numerical solution of the Dirac equation with an extended nuclear monopole potential. The diagonal and non-diagonal matrix elements of the electric quadrupole interaction have to be calculated via numerical integrations as well, before diagonalizing the total Hamiltonian. Since finite basis set methods~\cite{Shabaev2004} are used in this thesis for solving the Dirac equation, a numerical approximation of the complete muonic spectrum is obtained. Therefore, in the framework of this thesis, numerical evaluations of the corrections in Eq.~\eqref{eq:pert_secondOrderEnerg} without approximations is possible.\\

In the following Sections, the approach of almost degenerate perturbation theory from Section~\ref{sec:almostDeg} will be applied to muonic atoms considering electric monopole and quadrupole interaction, as well as magnetic dipole interaction. The starting point is a given deformed nuclear charge distribution $\rho(\mathbf{r})$ and a distribution of the static currents $\mathbf{j}(\mathbf{r})$ inside the nucleus.
The necessary steps are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Definition of the unperturbed  and perturbed Hamiltonian
\item Calculation of the potentials starting from the given charge and current distribution
\item Solving the unperturbed Hamiltonian
\item Definition of modelspace(s)
\item Calculation of diagonal and non-diagonal matrix elements of the perturbation in the modelspace and rediagonalization
\item Calculation of energy correction due to states outside of the modelspace
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Non-diagonal elements of hyperfine interactions}
\label{sec:non-diagElements}
The unperturbed Hamiltonian for describing the muonic atom are already given for the nuclear part in Eq.~\eqref{eq:muonicEn} and for the muonic part in Eq.~\eqref{eq:nuclEn} in terms of the nuclear charge distribution $\rho(\mathbf{r})$. The corresponding states of define total angular momentum $F$ are given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:totalState}.
The next step for calculating the hyperfine structure of muonic atoms in the framework of almost degenerate perturbation theory is the calculation of the diagonal and non-diagonal matrix elements of the electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole interaction.

For expressing the electric quadrupole interaction in terms of the charge distribution $\rho(\mathbf{r})$ including the non-diagonal matrix elements, the starting point is the multipole expansion of the electric potential from Eq.~\eqref{eq:defmulti}. The quadrupole terms with $l=2$ is
\begin{equation}
V^{(2)}_{\text{el}}(\mathbf{r}_\mu,\phi,\theta)=-Z\alpha \left[ \int \text{d}^3\mathbf{r}^{\prime}_N \frac{r_<^2}{r_>^{3}}\text{P}_{2}(\cos \vartheta_N^{\prime})\rho(\mathbf{r}_N^{\,\prime})\right]\sum_{m=-2}^2 \text{C}^*_{2m}(\theta,\phi)\text{C}_{2m}(\vartheta_\mu,\varphi_\mu).
\label{eq:quadPot}
\end{equation}
As a next step, the matrix element of~\eqref{eq:quadPot} with two arbitrary states from Eq.~\eqref{eq:totalState} is considered, which reads as
\begin{equation}
\Delta E^{(2)}=\left<F_1M_1\,I_1K \,n_1\kappa_1 \middle| V^{(2)}_{\text{el}} \middle|F_2M_2\,I_2K \,n_2\kappa_2 \right>.
\label{eq:quadPotEl}
\end{equation}
Keeping in mind that $\text{C}_{lm}^*(\vartheta,\varphi) =(-1)^m\text{C}_{l\,(-m)}(\vartheta,\varphi)$, and that the normalized spherical harmonic are irreducible tensor operators as introduced in Appendix~\ref{app:ang_theo}, the sum in Eq.~\eqref{eq:quadPot} is a scaler product of two rank-2 irreducible tensors. Therefore, Eq.~\eqref{app:reducedMatEl_expectation} can be used for expressing the matrix element from Eq.~\eqref{eq:quadPotEl} in terms of the reduced matrix elements of the spherical harmonics as
\begin{alignat}{2}
&\Delta E^{(2)} =&& -Z\alpha\delta_{F_1F_2}\delta_{M_1M_2} (-1)^{F+I_2+j(\kappa_1)}
\begin{Bmatrix}
I_1 & I_2 & 2 \\
j(\kappa_2) & j(\kappa_1)&F
\label{eq:quadNonDiagEl}

where it is useful to define

\label{eq:quadDistr}
f_Q(r_\mu)/r_\mu^3 \coloneqq \int \text{d}^3\mathbf{r}^{\prime}_N \frac{r_<^2}{r_>^{3}}\text{P}_{2}(\cos \vartheta_N^{\prime})\rho(\mathbf{r}_N^{\,\prime}),
\end{equation}
since for the approximation of a point-like quadrupole moment or in general for large $r_\mu$ it holds that $f_Q(r_\mu)=1$, and thus the usual $r_\mu^{-3}$ radial integral for quadrupole hyperfine structure is recovered. Accordingly, $f_Q(r_\mu)$ describes the finite distribution of the quadrupole moment inside the nucleus. The reduced matrix element in the nuclear coordinates can be calculated using the rigid rotor wave functions from Appendix~\ref{app:rig_rotor} and the definition of the reduce matrix element from Eq.~\eqref{app:wignerEckardt}. It is given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:rigidRotRedElement} and reads as
\begin{equation}
\left< I_1K\middle|\middle|\text{C}_l\middle|\middle|I_2K\right>=(-1)^{I_2+K}
\sqrt{(2I_1+1)(2I_2+1)}
\left(
\begin{matrix}
I_1&I_2&l\\
-K&K&0
\end{matrix}
\right).
\end{equation}
The reduced matrix elements in the muonic variables can be evaluated as~\cite{johnson2007}
\begin{alignat}{2}
&&&\left< n_1\kappa_1\big{|}\big{|}f(r_\mu)\text{C}_l(\vartheta_\mu,\varphi_\mu) \big{|}\big{|}n_2\kappa_2\right> =

\end{alignat}
where $f_{n\kappa}(r_\mu)$ and $g_{n\kappa}(r_\mu)$ are the radial wave function~\eqref{eq:radial_equations_small} obtained by solving the Dirac equation~\eqref{eq:muonicEn}.
The function
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:parityFunc}
\pi(x) =
\left\{
\begin{matrix}
1\,\text{, x even;}\phantom{11}\\
0\,\text{, otherwise}
\end{matrix}
\right.
\end{equation}
is needed for parity selection rules.
Thus, the evaluation of one reduced muonic matrix element requires one numerical integration, and for every calculation of $f_Q(r_\mu)$ therein, a numerical integration of Eq.~\eqref{eq:quadDistr} has to be performed.

For the magnetic dipole interaction, the diagonal matrix elements have been given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:hmag}. In the following, it will be extended to non-diagonal matrix elements in the framework of the rigid roton nuclear model, following the analysis in~\cite{Steffen1985}. The magnetic Hamiltonian due to the vector potential $\mathbf{A}_N$ caused by the nuclear static currents reads in the nuclear body fixed frame as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Hmag_rot}
\text{H}_{M}(\mathbf{r}_\mu) = |e|\,\boldsymbol{\alpha}\cdot \mathbf{A}_N(\mathbf{r}_\mu),
\end{equation}
where the vector potential is generated by the static currents in the nucleus, and the connection reads~\cite{jackson1999}
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{A}_N(\mathbf{r}_\mu) = \frac{1}{4\pi}\int\text{d}^3\mathbf{r}^\prime \frac{\mathbf{j}(\mathbf{r}^\prime)}{|\mathbf{r}_\mu-\mathbf{r}^\prime|}.
\end{equation}
For extended nuclei, i.e. without a divergence in the origin, the current distribution can be expressed in terms of the curl of another vector field, since the divergence of the current distribution in the static case is zero~\cite{jackson1999}. This field is called magnetization $\mathbf{M}(\mathbf{r})$, and the connection between current distribution and magnetization is
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{j}(\mathbf{r}) = \boldsymbol{\nabla} \times  \mathbf{M}(\mathbf{r}).
\end{equation}
The restriction to magnetic dipole interactions is done by writing the magnetization as
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{M}(\mathbf{r})=\boldsymbol{\mu}f(r)=|\boldsymbol{\mu}|\mathbf{e}_z^\prime\,f(r),
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ is the nuclear magnetic dipole operator and the second equality follows from the fact, that the symmetric rigid rotor model is used and the magnetic moment has to be aligned with the nuclear body fixed $z$-axis $\mathbf{e}_z^\prime$ for not violating axial symmetry.
In Cartesian coordinates in the laboratory system, the basis vector $\mathbf{e}_z^\prime$ of the body fixed system reads as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:magMomOp}
\boldsymbol{\mu}(\theta,\phi)=|\boldsymbol{\mu}|
\begin{pmatrix}
\sin\theta\cos\phi \\ \sin\theta\sin\phi \\ \cos\theta
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
The scalar function $f(r)$ describes the finite distribution of the dipole moment in the nucleus, which is responsible for the Bohr-Weisskopf effect~\cite{bohrWeisskopf1950} and is normalized by
\begin{equation}
4\pi\int_0^\infty \text{d}r\,r^2\,f(r)=1.
\end{equation}
Thereby, the magnetic Hamiltonian can be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:hmag_rot2}
\text{H}_M(\mathbf{r}_\mu,\theta,\phi) =\frac{|e|}{4\pi}\boldsymbol{\mu}(\theta,\phi)\cdot
\left( F_{\text{BW}}(r)\frac{\mathbf{r}}{r^3}\times \boldsymbol{\alpha}\right),
\end{equation}
which agrees with Eq.~\eqref{eq:Hmag}, and the function $F_{\text{BW}}(r)$ is connected to the distribution function $f(r)$ as
\begin{equation}
F_{\text{BW}}(r)=-4\pi r^2\partial_r \left(\int_0^\infty\text{d}r^\prime \frac{r^{\prime\,2}f(r^\prime)}{\max (r,r^\prime)}\right).
\end{equation}
The magnetic dipole Hamiltonien from Eq.~\eqref{eq:hmag_rot2} can be written as a scalar product of two rank-1 irreducible tensor operator acting on the muonic and nuclear coordinates, respectively, as~\cite{johnson2007}
\begin{alignat}{2}
&\text{H}_M  (\mathbf{r}_\mu,\theta,\phi) &&=\sum_{\lambda=-1}^1 (-1)^\lambda \;t_\lambda(\mathbf{r}_\mu) \;\;\mu_{-\lambda}(\theta,\phi),\notag\\[7.5pt]
&t_\lambda(\mathbf{r}_\mu) &&= \frac{-i\sqrt{2}|e|}{4\pi}\left(\boldsymbol{\alpha}\cdot\mathbf{C}^{(0)}_{1\lambda}(\vartheta_\mu,\varphi_\mu)\right)\frac{F_{\text{BW}}(r_\mu)}{r_\mu^2}\,\notag,
\end{alignat}
where $\mathbf{C}^{(a)}_{b\,c}(\vartheta,\varphi)$ are the vector spherical harmonics~\cite[Section 7.]{varshalovich1988}, and $\mu_\lambda$ with $\lambda \in \left\{-1,0,1\right\}$ the spherical components~\cite[Section 1.]{varshalovich1988} of the magnetic moment operator from Eq.~\eqref{eq:magMomOp}. Correspondingly, Eq.~\eqref{app:reducedMatEl_expectation} can be used for the calculation of expectation values, and the result is
\begin{alignat}{2}
& \left<F_1M_1\,I_1K\,n_1\kappa_1 \middle|\text{H}_M \middle|F_2M_2\,I_2K\,n_2\kappa_2 \right> = \delta_{F_1F_2}\delta_{M_1M_2}(-1)^{F_1+j(\kappa_2)+I_1}\\[7.5pt]

The reduced matrix elements of the magnetic moment operator can be obtained by using literature values of the magnetic moment  from~\cite{Stone2005} and using Eq.~\eqref{eq:rigidRotRedElement} and the relation
\begin{equation}
\left< IK\middle|\middle|\mu \middle|\middle|IK\right> =

\subsubsection{Toy model for Rediagonalization}
\label{sec:toyModelRediag}
The concept of rediagonalization in the context of almost degenerate perturbation theory was introduced in Section~\ref{sec:almostDeg}. The unperturbed Hamiltonian is introduced in Eqs.~\eqref{eq:muonicEn} and~\eqref{eq:nuclEn} for the unperturbed states from Eq.~\eqref{eq:totalState}. The matrix elements necessary for the rediagonalization of the hyperfine states are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:non-diagElements} in the general case. Thereby, all necessary ingredients for the rediagonalization in the dynamic hyperfine structure of muonic atoms is available. In this Section, the concept is applied to a simplified part of the muonic $^{185}$Re spectrum for clarification. The $^{185}$Re nucleus has a ground state angular momentum of $5/2$~\cite{Stone2005}, and in this Section, the first two excited nuclear states with angular momentum quantum numbers of $7/2$ and $9/2$ are considered. As for the muonic states, the $2p$ fine-structure doublet is considered, these are the $2p1/2$ and $2p3/2$ states, whis corresponds to the values for the quantum numbers $(n,\kappa)$ being $(2,1)$, and $(2,-2)$. This modelspace is called $M$ from hereon.
As a first step, it has to be considered, which unperturbed states $\left|FM\,IK\,n\kappa\right>$ can be formed by the nuclear and muonic states. In general, for every possible value of $F$, the projection quantum number $M\in \{-F,...,F\}$. The maximal value for $F$ is $F_{\text{max}}=\max(j(\kappa)+I)_{\kappa, I \in M}$. The minimal value for F is $F_{\text{min}}=\min(|j(\kappa)-I|)_{\kappa, I \in M}$. In this example, the values are $F_{\text{max}}=6$ and $F_{\text{min}}=1$ and correspondingly $F\in\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$. As a next step, it has to be checked for every value of $F$, which combinations of muonic and nuclear states of the modelspace are able to form the $F$ value. For this, it has to hold that $|j(\kappa)-I|\leq F \leq j(\kappa)+I$. In this way, a modelspace is separated into distinct blocks, each with a value of $F$ and a corresponding subset of states from the modelspace, which can form this $F$ value. Since the hyperfine interactions are diagonal in $F$ and $M$, the rediagonalization has to be performed only in the block separately, not in the entire modelspace. The separation of the modelspace into the different blocks is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:blockRe}. For the nuclear excitation energies from~\cite{ENSDF} and the RMS radius from~\cite{Angeli2013}, the resulting level scheme without and with rediagonalized quadrupole interaction is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:quad2}, which demonstrates the rich level structure in this case. Furthermore, there is no clear distinction between the fine- and hyperfine structure, sine the nuclear rotational states, the fine-structure splitting and the quadrupole matrix elements are all on the same energy scale. In practice, for the calculations is Sec.~\ref{sec:muon_re}, up to five excited nuclear states are used, which leads to even more energy levels.

Due to the rediagonalization, the unperturbed states $\left|FM\,IK\,n\kappa\right>$ are mixed. The quantum numbers $F$ and $M$, describing the total angular momentum of the muon-nucleus system are still good quantum numbers, since the hyperfine structure is diagonal therein. However, different $I$, $\kappa$, and in principle also $n$ are mixed by the rediagonalization, and a mixed state are written as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:rediagonState}
\left|FM,\,i\right> = \sum_{k=1}^d \alpha^{(i)}_k \left| FM\,I_kK\,n_k\kappa_k\right>,
\end{equation}
where $i\in \{1,...,d\}$ and $d$ is the number of states in the modelspace, which can form the total angular momentum $F$. For the example of Rhenium in this Section, $d=1$ for $F=1,6$; $d=3$ for $F=2,5$; and $d=5$ for $F=3,4$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:blockRe}). Thus, e.g. for $F=3$, a 5x5-matrix has to be rediagonalized, and the coefficient-matrix $\alpha^{(i)}_k$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:rediagonState} corresponds to the matrix of eigenvectors.

Through the nuclear rotational states and the strong quadrupole interaction, there is no clear distinction between fine- and hyperfine structure, which results in a rich structure of the energy levels.}%

\subsection{Transition probabilities and intensities}
It has been shown in Sec.~\ref{sec:muon_dynamic} that the coupling of muonic states and nuclear rotational states in connection with a strong quadrupole interaction leads to a rich and complicated level structure without a clear distinction of fine- and hyperfine structure. As a result, there is a large number of potential transitions between the states. For example, if the $L$ x rays are considered, i.e. the transitions from the $3d$ fine structure doublet to the $2p$ fine structure doublet, there are only four transitions if the hyperfine structure is not considered. One of these transitions is suppressed because it is not an electric dipole transition. On the other hand, due to the dynamic hyperfine structure, there are in principle hundreds of $L$ x rays, many of them electric dipole type. As a consequence, for the comparison with experimental spectra, not only the level structure is needed, but also the corresponding relative intensities. Important for the comparison with experiments in the intensity of a transition, which is proportional to the number of measured photons with the energy of the transitions. The intensities are a product of two quantities:
Firstly, the intensity is proportional to the transition probability, which can be calculated in principle, as soon as the wave functions and corresponding energies are known. In this thesis, the transition probabilities are calculated relativistically and without the long-wavelength approximation.
Secondly, the intensities are proportional to the population of the initial state. However, for calculating the population of the initial states, all transitions to the initial state from even higher states have to be considered. This eventually leads to a cascade calculation for the muon, where the muon is . In the following the transition probabilities and the the population and cascade calculations are discussed separately.\\

As a first step, the transition probabilities due to spontaneous emission of a photon in a muonic transition is analyzed in this paragraph. Starting point is the general formula for the Einstein coefficient (transition probability per time) for state with defined total angular momentum from an initial state $\left|F_iM_i,i_i\right>$ to a final state $\left|F_fM_f,i_f\right>$, where the states, in which the hyperfine structure is diagonalized, are defined in Eq.~\eqref{eq:rediagonState}. Following~\cite[Section 6.]{johnson2007}, this expression reads as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:transitionGeneral}
A^{(\lambda)}_{J}=\frac{2\alpha (2J+1)(J+1)}{J}\Delta E\,\sum_{M,M_i,M_f} \left|\left<F_fM_f,i_f\middle|\hat{t}^{(\lambda)}_{JM}\middle|F_iM_f,i_i\right>\right|^2,
\end{equation}
where $\Delta E$ is the energy difference of the initial and final state, $J$ is the total angular momentum of the photon and $\lambda=1$ is an electric transition, whereas $\lambda=0$ is a magnetic transition. The multipole transition operator $\hat{t}^{(\lambda)}_{JM}$ is defined in Eqs.~(6.120), (6.121), (6.128),(6.129) of~\cite{johnson2007} in terms of the multipole components of the vectorpotential $\mathbf{a}^{(\lambda)}_{JM}$ and of the scalar potential $\Phi_{JM}$ as
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\alpha}\cdot \mathbf{a}^{(\lambda)}_{JM}(\mathbf{r}_\mu) - \Phi_{JM}(\mathbf{r}_\mu) = i\sqrt{\frac{(2J+1)(J+1)}{4\pi J}}\hat{t}^{(\lambda)}_{JM}(\mathbf{r}_\mu).
\end{equation}
Using the definition of Eq.~\eqref{eq:rediagonState} for the definition of the mixed states is terms of the unperturbed states $\left| FM\,IK\,n\kappa\right>$, the matrix elements are written as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tranElement1}
\left<F_fM_f,i_f\middle|\hat{t}^{(\lambda)}_{JM}\middle|F_iM_f,i_i\right> =
\sum_{k_i,\,k_f}\alpha^{(i_f)\,*}_{k_f} \alpha^{(i_i)}_{k_i}\left<F_fM_f\,I_{k_f}K\,n_{k_f}\kappa_{k_f} \middle|\hat{t}^{(\lambda)}_{JM}\middle|F_iM_i\,I_{k_i}K\,n_{k_i}\kappa_{k_i}\right>.
\end{equation}
Since muonic transitions are considered in this section, it acts on the muonic coordinates $\mathbf{r}_\mu$, which is one subsystem of the composite states in Eq.~\eqref{eq:transitionGeneral} with total angular momentum $F_i$ and $F_f$, respectively. Since the multipole transition operator is an irreducible tensor operator of rank $J$, Eq.~\eqref{app:subsystem_expectation} can be used for calculating the matrix elements. This results in the following expression for the matrix elements:
\begin{alignat}{2}
\left<F_fM_f\,I_{k_f}K\,n_{k_f}\kappa_{k_f} \middle|\hat{t}^{(\lambda)}_{JM}\middle|F_iM_i\,I_{k_i}K\,n_{k_i}\kappa_{k_i}\right>=\delta_{I_{k_f}I_{k_i}}(-1)^{F_i+j(\kappa_{k_f})+I_{k_i}-J}
\notag\\[7.5pt]
\times\sqrt{2F_i+1}\text{C}^{F_fM_f}_{F_iM_i\,JM}
\begin{Bmatrix}
j(\kappa_{k_i})&j(\kappa_{k_f})&J\\
F_f&F_i&I_{k_i}
\end{Bmatrix}
\left< n_{k_f}\kappa_{k_f}\middle|\middle|\hat{t}^{(\lambda)}_{J}\middle|\middle|n_{k_i}\kappa_{k_i}\right>
\label{eq:tranElement2}
\end{alignat}
The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients in Eq.~\eqref{eq:tranElement2} do not depend on the summation indices $k_i$ and $k_f$, and the only dependency on the projection numbers $M$, $M_f$, and $M_i$ are as arguments of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Therefore, the summation over $M$, $M_f$, $M_i$ only affacts the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient and the sum rule~\cite{varshalovich1988}
\begin{equation}
\sum_{M,M_i,M_f}\left(C^{F_fM_f}_{F_iM_i\,JM}\right)^2 = 2F_f+1
\end{equation}
can be used to simplify the calculation of Eq.~\eqref{eq:transitionGeneral} considerably. The reduced matrix elements in the muonic variables in Eq.\eqref{eq:tranElement2} can be evaluated in length gauge as~\cite{johnson2007}
\begin{alignat}{2}
\label{eq:relElTrans}
&\left< n_{f}\kappa_{f}\middle|\middle|\hat{t}^{(1)}_{J}\middle|\middle|n_{i}\kappa_{i}\right>=&&

&&& +j_J(\Delta E\,r)\text{\huge(}\frac{\kappa_i-\kappa_f}{J+1}

&&& +\left(G_{n_i\kappa_i}(r)F_{n_f\kappa_f}(r)-G_{n_f\kappa_f}(r)F_{n_i\kappa_i}(r)\right)
 \text{\huge)}\text{\huge]}
\end{alignat}
for electric transitions with $\lambda= 1 $ and as
\begin{alignat}{2}
&\left< n_{f}\kappa_{f}\middle|\middle|\hat{t}^{(0)}_{J}\middle|\middle|n_{i}\kappa_{i}\right>=&&
\left<n_f\,{-}{\kappa_f}\middle|\middle|C_J\middle|\middle|n_i\kappa_i\right>\notag\\

\end{alignat}
for magnetic transitions with $\lambda = 0$. $j_J(x)$ are the spherical Bessel functions~\cite[Eq. 10.47.3]{NIST:DLMF}.
The reduced matrix elements of the normalized spherical harmonics $\text{C}_{JM}(\vartheta,\varphi)$ read as~\cite{johnson2007}
\begin{alignat}{2}
&\left<n_f\kappa_f\middle|\middle|C_J\middle|\middle|n_i\kappa_i\right>=&&(-1)^{j(\kappa_f)+1/2}\sqrt{(2j(\kappa_i)+1)(2j(\kappa_f)+1)}
\begin{pmatrix}
j(\kappa_f)&j(\kappa_i)&J\\
-\nicefrac{1}{2}&\nicefrac{1}{2}&0
\end{pmatrix}
\notag\\
&&&\times\pi(l(\kappa_f)+l(\kappa_i)+J),
\label{eq:reducedCjmuonic}
\end{alignat}
where the function $\pi(x)$ is defined in Eq.~\eqref{eq:parityFunc}. The angular momentum selection rules are implemented in the six-J- and three-J-symbols and in the function $\pi(x)$ in Eqs.~\eqref{eq:tranElement2} and~\eqref{eq:reducedCjmuonic}. For the example of electric dipole transitions with $J=1$ and $\lambda=1$, the following selection rules have to be fulfilled:
\begin{alignat}{4}
&j(\kappa_i)&&=j(\kappa_f) &&\text{ or } j(\kappa_i)&&=j(\kappa_f)\pm 1;\\
&F_i &&= F_f &&\text{ or } F_i&&=F_j\pm 1;\\
&l(\kappa_i)&&=l(\kappa_f)\pm 1.
\label{eq:dipoleSelectionRules}
\end{alignat}
The relativistic expression for the electric transitions in Eq.~\eqref{eq:relElTrans} can be simplified in the non-relativistic and long-wavelenth approximation. The non-relativstic approximation means, the lower component of the radial spinors $F_{n\kappa}(r)$ is small, and therefore mixed terms $F_{n_1\kappa_1}(r)G_{n_2\kappa_2}(r)$ can be neglected. The term $\sim F_{n\kappa}(r)^2$ is kept for convenience, since $G_{n\kappa}(r)^2+F_{n\kappa}(r)^2$ corresponds to the probability density. The long-wavelength approximation means, that $\Delta E \, r$ is small, and therefore the corresponding spherical Bessel function can be expanded. The spherical Bessel functions can be approximated as
\begin{equation}
j_J(x)\approx \frac{x^J}{(2J+1)!!},
\end{equation}
where the double factorial is evaluated as $y!! = y \cdot (y-2) \cdot (y-4) \cdot ...\,\,$. Thereby, Eq.~\eqref{eq:relElTrans} becomes
\begin{alignat}{2}
\label{eq:relElTransNR}
&\left< n_{f}\kappa_{f}\middle|\middle|\hat{t}^{(1)}_{J}\middle|\middle|n_{i}\kappa_{i}\right>=&&
\left<n_f\kappa_f\middle|\middle|C_J\middle|\middle|n_i\kappa_i\right>\\
&&&\times\frac{\Delta E^J}{(2J+1)!!}\int\text{d}r \;r^J\left(G_{n_f\kappa_f}(r)G_{n_i\kappa_i}(r)+F_{n_i\kappa_i}(r)F_{n_f\kappa_f}(r)\right),
\end{alignat}
and the corresponding transition probabilities per time from Eq.~\eqref{eq:transitionGeneral} thereby have the typical dependence $\sim \Delta E ^{2J+1}$.\\

After the transition probabilities have been discussed in the last paragraph, the remaining issue of the population of the initial states is discussed in the following.
While the transition probabilities can be calculated separately from experimental details, this is not the case for the population. Muonic atoms are typically created by shooting a slow muon beem on a target, which contains the isotope of interest~\cite{wu1969,Devons1995,BorieRinker1982}. The statistical population of the muonic states after the muon has been captured by the nucleus depends on the state of the incoming muon as well as details of the nuclear target. Additionally, for highly excited states, the muon and the atomic electrons are not well separated, as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:screen}, thus the muon-electron interaction has to be taken into account and e.g. Auger transitions can occur~\cite{pisano1982}. In heavy nuclei, this leads to a complicated many-body problem. Then, even if an initial population of the low-lying muonic states, where the electron-muon interaction can be neglected, would be known in form of the diagonal elements of the muonic density matrix, the master equation using transition probabilities as described in the previous paragraph has to be solved~\cite{pisano1982}. This is not practical due to the large number of energy levels due to the dynamic hyperfine structure and the expensive calculation of the transition probabilities with Eq.~\eqref{eq:transitionGeneral}.

However, in experiments, muons typically tend to be captured in circular orbits, these are states with maximal angular momentum $l$=$n-1$. Additionally, the fastest transitions are electric dipole transitions of the muon, which change the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the muon by one. The most intense sequence of transitions are correspondingly the $5g\rightarrow 4f \rightarrow 3d \rightarrow 2p \rightarrow 1s$ transitions. Especially the $2p\rightarrow 1s$ ($K$ x rays) and $3d\rightarrow 2p$ ($L$ x rays) have been used in the past to obtain information about nuclear structure from experiments with muonic atoms, e.g. in \cite{tanaka1983,tanaka1984,tanaka1984_2,hitlin1970,Dey1979,dewit1966,Bergem1988}. Under the assumption, that the muon starts in a circular orbit and than cascades by electric dipole transitions, the calculation of the intensities is considerably simplified, using the selection rules from Eq.~\eqref{eq:dipoleSelectionRules}, since now the $2p$ state can be only populated by the $3d$ states, which can only be populated by the $4f$ states and so on, and this approach will be used also in this thesis. This means, the population of a state in the, say, $2p$ states can be obtained by summing up all intensities of the transitions from the $3d$ states to this state. Finally, only the initial population of the initial states with the highest $n$ (eg. $6h$, $5g$, $4f$) needs to be given. Here, a simple statistical population has proved to describe experiments correctly~\cite{Dey1979}, where every coupled muon-nucleus state with total angular momentum $F$ has a relative population $\sim (2F+1)$, corresponding to the different $M$ values. Furthermore, initially the nucleus is in its ground state, since the excitation of nuclear rotational levels only occurs during the muonic cascade, when energy is transfered from the muon to the nucleus.
The muonic cascade starting from the muonic $4f$ states is visualized in Fig.~\ref{fig:cascade}. In practice, the calculation of the spectrum, this is transition energies and corresponding intensities, begins with diagonalizing the hyperfine interaction in the fine structure doublets of the states with circular orbits ($2p$,$3d$,$4f$). Then, assuming a relative transition proportional to $2F+1$ in the fine-structure doublet with the highest quantum number $n=n_{\text{max}}$, all transitions to the next states with $n_{\text{max}-1}$ are calculated. The relative population of the $n_{\text{max}-1}$ states is obtained by summing up the intensities of all transitions to this state. This procedure can be repeated until the muonic ground state is reached, and thereby all line-intensities are obtained. A statistical population $\sim 2F+1$ in the higher states leads to a statistical population in the lower states, as long as the hyperfine-structure  splitting can be neglected. In states with $n>3$, the hyperfine-structure splitting is typically small. Therefore, statistically populated $6h$ states lead to (almost) statistically populated $5g$, which in turn (almost) result in statistically populated $4f$ states. Thereby, the line intensities are insensitive on the starting point of the cascade. The calculation of transition probabilities is used in Sec.~\ref{sec:muon_re} for analyzing the spectrum of muonic Rhenim-185.

\section{Higher order corrections for the dynamic hyperfine structure}
In this Section, the improved calculations of two higher order contributions to the dynamic hyperfine structure are discussed, namely the second order quadrupole interaction beyond the rediagonalization in the modelspaces and the correction to the matrix elements of the quadrupole interactions due to leading order vacuum polarization (VP) due to a virtual electron-positron pair.\\
The contribution of leading order vacuum polarization (VP) to the spherically symmetric part of the charge distribution was briefly discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:qed}. However, VP influences multipole interactions of all orders, thus in the context of the dynamic hyperfine structure especially the matrix elements of the quadrupole interaction. In the past, the corresponding correction to the quadrupole interaction between muon and nucleus has at most been considered with a power-series expansion~\cite{Fricke1969vp,zehnder1975} or for specific forms of the nuclear charge distribution~\cite{pearson1963}, which does not enable precision calculations for heavy muonic atoms. In this thesis, a new approach is developed in Section~\ref{sec:muon_quadUehl} by performing a multipole expansion of the Uehling potential. This enables the calculation of the leading order VP correction to the quadrupole matrix elements for arbitrary charge distributions, including all finite size effects.\\
The approach of almost degenerate perturbation theory is discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:almostDeg}, and the rediagonalization of the perturbation is applied to the hyperfine interaction in Sec.~\ref{sec:non-diagElements} and~\ref{sec:toyModelRediag}. However, there are residual second order corrections due to contrubutions from outside of the modelspace, as introduced in Eq.~\eqref{eq:pert_secondOrderEnerg}. A non-relativistic estimation of the residual second order electric quadrupole interaction with states outside of this modelspace has been presented in Ref.~\cite{chen1970}. In this thesis, a fully relativistic approach is presented in Sec.~\ref{sec:muon_residualSO}.

\subsection{Quadrupole-Uehling interactions}
\label{sec:muon_quadUehl}
The resummation of the order $\alpha (Z\alpha)$ Vacuum polarization (Uehling potential) has been discussed in Section~\ref{sec:vacPolTheory}, with the result that it can be included in the solution of the Dirac equation. The starting point in this Section is the renormalized expression for the Uehling potential for a given, possibly deformed nuclear charge distribution, which reads in the chosen system of units (Appendix~\ref{app:conventions}) as~\cite{Fullerton1976}
\begin{equation}
{V_{\text{uehl}}(\mathbf{r}_\mu^{\,\prime})}{=}{-Z\alpha\frac{2 \alpha}{3\pi} \int \text{d}^3\mathbf{r}_N^{\prime} \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r}_N^{\,\prime})}{|\mathbf{r}_\mu^{\,\prime} - \mathbf{r}_N^{\,\prime}\,|} K_1(2m_e{|\mathbf{r}_\mu^{\,\prime} - \mathbf{r}_N^{\,\prime}\,|}),}
\label{eq:Vvp}
\end{equation}
where $m_e$ is the electron mass, and primed coordinates belong to the body-fixed nuclear system, as defined in~\ref{sec:muon_framework}. $K_1(x)$ belongs to the family of functions
\begin{equation}
K_n(x)=\int_1^\infty \text{d}t\,\text{e}^{-xt}\left(\frac{1}{t^3}+\frac{1}{2t^5}\right)\sqrt{t^2-1}t^n.
\label{eq:defKn}
\end{equation}
The functions $K_n(x)$ are related for different $n$ by
\begin{alignat}{2}
&K_n(x)&&=-\partial_x K_{n-1}(y),\\
&K_{n-1}(x)&&=-\int^x\text{d}y\, K_n(y).
\label{eq:Kninfo}
\end{alignat}
Furthermore, they can be expressed in terms of Meijer G functions from Eq.~\eqref{app:def_meijerG} as
\begin{equation}
K_n(x)=\frac{1}{4} {G_{1, 3}^{3, 0}\left({\frac{x^{2}}{4}}\middle|\begin{matrix}   - \frac{n}{2} + 2 \\- \frac{n}{2} + \frac{1}{2}, 0, \frac{1}{2}   \end{matrix}   \right)} + \frac{1}{8} {G_{1, 3}^{3, 0}\left(\frac{x^2}{4}\middle| \begin{matrix}   - \frac{n}{2} + 3 \\- \frac{n}{2} + \frac{3}{2}, 0, \frac{1}{2}   \end{matrix}  \right)},
\label{eq:defKnAnalyt}
\end{equation}
which enables evaluation using arbitrary precision implementations of the Meijer G function of existing libraries or programs like~\cite{Mathematica,mpmath}. The Uehling potential from Eq.~\eqref{eq:Vvp} depends only on $|\mathbf{r}_\mu^{\,\prime} - \mathbf{r}_N^{\,\prime}\,|$, similar to the electric potential~\eqref{eq:defmulti}, which can be written as
\begin{equation}
|\mathbf{r}_\mu^{\,\prime} - \mathbf{r}_N^{\,\prime}|
=|\mathbf{r}_\mu - \mathbf{r}_N|
=\sqrt{r_\mu^2 + r_N^2 - 2 r_\mu r_N y},
\end{equation}
and therefore only depends on the absolute values of the vectors and on ${y}{=}{\cos(\sphericalangle \mathbf{r}_\mu\mathbf{r}_N)}$. The dependence on $|\mathbf{r}_\mu^{\,\prime} - \mathbf{r}_N^{\,\prime}\,|$ is more complicated for the Uehling potential, but a multipole expansion can be performed nonetheless by expanding the dependence on $y$ in Legendrepolynomials, which reads as
\begin{alignat}{2}
&\frac{K_1(2m_e{|\mathbf{r}_\mu^{\,\prime} - \mathbf{r}^{\,\prime}\,|})}{|\mathbf{r}_\mu^{\,\prime} - \mathbf{r}^{\,\prime}\,|}
&&=\sum_{l=0}^\infty c_l(r_\mu,r_N) P_l(y)\\
&&&=\sum_{l=0}^\infty c_l(r_\mu,r_N) \sum_{m=-l}^l \text{C}^*_{lm}(\vartheta_N^{\prime},\varphi_N^{\prime})\text{C}_{lm}(\vartheta_\mu^\prime,\varphi_\mu^\prime),\notag
\end{alignat}
where the second equality is a consequence of the addition theorem~\eqref{eq:legendreAddTheorem} of Legendre polynomials, and the expansion coefficients, which are still a function of the absolute values of the vectors, are defined as
\begin{equation}
c_l(r_\mu,r_N)=\frac{2l+1}{2} \int_{-1}^1 \text{d}y \frac{K_1(2m_e{|\mathbf{r}_\mu - \mathbf{r}_N|})}{|\mathbf{r}_\mu - \mathbf{r}_N|} P_l(y).
\label{eq:defcl}
\end{equation}
Eq.~\eqref{eq:defcl} can be either solved by numerical integration, or it can also be expressed in closed form, using Eq.~\eqref{eq:defKnAnalyt} for the functions $K_n(x)$. For the closed form expression, the integration variable $y$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:defcl} is sustituted by $z=f^{-1}(y)=2m_e{|\mathbf{r}_\mu - \mathbf{r}_N|}$ or $y=f(z)=(r_\mu^2+r_N^2 -(z/2m)^2)/(2r_\mu r_N)$. Thereby, Eq.~\eqref{eq:defcl} reads as
\begin{equation}
c_l(r_\mu,r_N)=\frac{2l+1}{4 r_\mu r_N m_e}\mathop\int\limits_{2m_e{|r_\mu - r_N|}}^{2m_e{(r_\mu + r_N)}} \text{d}z\, K_1(z)P_l(f(z)).
\label{eq:defcl2}
\end{equation}
Now, using that the $l$-th Legendre polynomials are polynomials of degree $l$, and that $f(z)$ is quadratic in $z$, it follows that $P_l(f(z))$ is a polynomial of degree $2l$. Thereby, Eq.\eqref{eq:defcl2} can be integrated by part $2l$-times for the two functions $K_1(z)$ and $P_l(f(z))$, using the relations from Eq.~\eqref{eq:Kninfo}, to solve the integral as
\begin{equation}
c_l(r_\mu,r_N)=\frac{2l+1}{4 r_\mu r_N m_e}
\sum\limits_{i=0}^{2l} K_{-i}(z)\,\partial^{(i)}_yP_l(f(z))\text{\huge |}^{y=2m_e{|r_\mu - r_N|}}_{y=2m_e{(r_\mu + r_N)}}.
\label{eq:defcl3}
\end{equation}
Thereby, the Uehling potential can be written, analogously to the electric potential, as
\begin{align}
V_{\text{uehl}}(\mathbf{r}_\mu,\phi,\theta)=&\sum_{l=0}^\infty-Z\alpha\frac{2\alpha}{3\pi} 
 \int \text{d}^3r^{\prime}_N c_l(r_\mu,r_N)\text{P}_{l}(\cos \vartheta_N^{\prime})\rho(\mathbf{r}_N^{\,\prime})\sum_{m=-l}^l \text{C}^*_{lm}(\theta,\phi)\text{C}_{lm}(\vartheta_\mu,\varphi_\mu).\notag\\
=:&\sum_{l=0}^\infty Q^{(l)}_{\text{uehl}}(r_\mu)\,\sum_{m=-l}^lC^*_{lm}(\theta,\phi)C_{lm}(\vartheta_\mu,\varphi_\mu)&\notag\\
=:& \sum_{l=0}^\infty V^{(l)}_{\text{uehl}}(\mathbf{r}_\mu,\phi,\theta).
\label{eq:defmultiuehl}
\end{align}
For $l=0$, the expression for Uehling potential of a spherical charge distribution~\cite{Fullerton1976} which only depends on $r_\mu$ is recovered as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:sph_uehl}
V^{(0)}_{\text{uehl}}(r_\mu)=& -\frac{2\alpha (Z\alpha)}{3 m_e r}\int_0^\infty \text{d}r^{\prime}\,\rho_0(r^\prime)\left[K_0(2m_e|r-r^\prime|)-K_0(2m_e(r+r^\prime))\right]\notag
\end{align}
where the spherically averaged part of the charge distribution is
\begin{equation}
\rho_0(r)=\int_0^{2\pi}\text{d}\varphi\int_0^\pi\text{d}\vartheta \sin(\vartheta)\rho(\mathbf{r}\,)/(4\pi).
\end{equation}
The approach is applicable for arbitrary charge distributions, and is applied for the quadrupole term with $l=2$ in Sec.~\ref{sec:muon_re}. In the following, the quadrupole term $l=2$ is considered for the models of a charged-shell and point-like quadrupole distribution, where the corresponding term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:defmultiuehl} can be simplified. For the charged-shell quadrupole distribution, the nuclear charge distribution is written as
\begin{alignat}{2}
&\rho(\mathbf{r}_N)&&=\rho_0(r_N) + \rho_2(r_N,\vartheta_N)\\
&\rho_2(r_N,\vartheta_N)&&=-\alpha Q_0 \frac{5}{8\pi }\frac{\delta(r-R)}{R^4}
P_2(\cos\vartheta_N),
\end{alignat}
where the intrinsic quadrupole moment $Q_0$ is concentrated at the nuclear radius $R$. Thereby, the quadrupole part of the Uehling potential~\eqref{eq:defmultiuehl} reads
\begin{equation}
V^{(2)}_{\text{uehl}}(\mathbf{r}_\mu,\phi,\theta)= 
-\alpha Q_0 \frac{\alpha}{3\pi}\frac{c_2(r_\mu,R)}{R^2}\sum\limits_{m=-l}^{l} C_{lm}^*(\theta,\phi)C_{lm}(\vartheta_\mu,\varphi_\mu).
\label{eq:quadUehlShell}
\end{equation}
The limit of a point-like quadrupole moment is the limit of zero nuclear radius $R$ in Eq.\eqref{eq:quadUehlShell}. However, the limit cannot be calculated naively due to the $R^{2}$ factor in the denominator, but it turns out that the Taylor expansion of $c_2(r_\mu,R)$ around $R=0$ has no constant and linear term. Therefore, $c_2(r_\mu,R)$ can be expanded for small $R$ as
\begin{equation}
c_2(r_\mu,R) = \frac{K_1(2m_er_\mu)+2m_er_\mu K_2(2m_er_\mu)+4m_e^2r_\mu^2/3K_3(2m_er_\mu)}{r^3}R^2 + \mathcal{O}(R^3),
\end{equation}
and therby the point-like limit of quadrupole Uehling potential reads
\begin{alignat}{2}
\label{eq:quadUehlpoint}
&V^{(2)}_{\text{uehl}}(\mathbf{r}_\mu,\phi,\theta)&&=
-\alpha Q_0\, g(r) \sum\limits_{m=-l}^{l} C_{lm}^*(\theta,\phi)C_{lm}(\vartheta_\mu,\varphi_\mu).\\
&\qquad\qquad g(r)&&=\frac{\alpha}{3\pi}\frac{K_1(2m_er_\mu)+2m_er_\mu K_2(2m_er_\mu)+4m_e^2r_\mu^2/3K_3(2m_er_\mu)}{r^3}.
\label{eq:quadUehlShellLimit}
\end{alignat}
The expressions for the quadrupole Uehling potential for the charged-sphere and point-like distributions from Eqs.~\eqref{eq:quadUehlShell} and \eqref{eq:quadUehlpoint}, respectively, can be used for testing the implementation of the general case in Eq.~\eqref{eq:defmultiuehl}.\\


\subsection{Residual second order corrections}
\label{sec:muon_residualSO}
The rediagonalization of the hyperfine interaction in muonic atoms is explained in Sec.~\ref{sec:muon_dynamic}, using a modelspace consisting of a muonic finestructure doublet and the first rotational nuclear states. Also, the leading contribution from states outside of the modelspace is derived in Eq.~\eqref{eq:pert_secondOrderEnerg}. Essentially, it is the second order energy correction due to the hyperfine interaction, excluding all states which are considered in the rediagonalization process. In the following, the residual second order corrections will be discussed for the example of the Rhenium $2p$ modelspace given in Sec.~\ref{sec:toyModelRediag}. Here, the modelspace consists of the muonic $2p\nicefrac{1}{2}$ and $2p\nicefrac{3}{2}$ states and the nuclear $5/2,7/2,9/2$ states. This results in 18 coupled states, with values of the total angular momentum between $F=1$ and $F=6$, as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:blockRe}. The set of these states is called $M$. The summation over all states, which are not in the modelspace involves all states $\left|FM\,I_iK_i\,n_i\kappa_i\right>$ as defined in \eqref{eq:totalState}, where not all quantum numbers coincide with a state in the modelspace $M$. In the following, this summation is schematically written as $\sum_{i\notin M}$.

After the subspace has been chosen and rediagonalization has been performed, the quadrupole interaction with states outside of the subspace leads to residual second order corrections to the energy levels~\cite{chen1970}. 
For the total second order correction a summation/integration over the complete (discrete and continous) spectrum for both nuclear and muonic states has to be performed. For the complete nuclear spectrum, sophisticated models or numerous experimental data are required. However, the muon is a point-like particle and can be described as a Dirac particle. Therefore, in this work, we calculate the second order corrections due to the electric quadrupole (Eq.~\eqref{eq:quadPot}) and quadrupole-Uehling interaction (${l}{=}{2}$-term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:defmultiuehl}), where the nucleus stays in the rotational ground state, but the complete muonic spectrum is considered.
For a composite state from Eq.~\eqref{eq:rediagonState}, where the hyperfine interaction is diagonalized in the modelspace, the second order energy shift due to states outside of the modelspace is
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{\text{2.ord.}}^{(F,k)}= \sum_{i\notin M}\frac{\left|\left< FMk\right|{V_{\text{el}}^{(2)}}{+}{V_{\text{uehl}}^{(2)}}\left|FMn_i\kappa_iI_iK \right>\right|^2}{E_{F,k}-E_i},
\label{eq:second}
\end{equation}
where the sum is to be taken over all states not considered in the rediagonalization, including continuum states of the muon, and the unperturbed energy of the state $i$ is $E_i=E_{n_i\kappa_i}+E_{I_i}$.














\subsection{Evaluation for Rhenium-185 and Uranium-235}
Calculations of the quadrupole-Uehling potential and the residual second order corrections have been performed for muonic Rhenium and Uranium, assuming a deformed Fermi nuclear charge distribution which reads as
\begin{equation}
\rho_{ca\beta}(\vec{r}\,)=\cfrac{N}{1+\exp (\frac{r-c(1+\beta \text{Y}_{20}(\vartheta))}{a})},
\label{eq:deffermi_2}
\end{equation}
where $c$ is the half-density radius, $a$ the skin thickness, $\beta$ the deformation parameter, and $N$ a normalization constant determined by the condition
\begin{equation}
\int \text{d}^3r\, \rho_{ca\beta}(\vec{r}\,)=1.
\end{equation}
Using the deformed Fermi distribution has proved to be very successful in the description of the level structure of heavy muonic atoms, e.g.~\cite{hitlin1970,tanaka1984,tanaka1984_2}.
Values for the parameters can be estimated by using a value ${a}{=}{2.3\,\text{fm}/(4\ln 3)}$, which has proved to be a sufficiently accurate value for most nuclei~\cite{Beier2000}. Then, $c$ and $\beta$ are chosen such that the quadrupole moment and RMS value of the distribution are in agreement with the literature values from~\cite{Angeli2013,Stone2005}. For the nuclear states involved in the dynamic hyperfine structure, also the excitation energies are needed from literature~\cite{ENSDF}. The used parameters are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:params}.
With these parameters, the electric and Uehling potentials, both monopole and quadrupole parts, can be calculated numerically. The muon wave functions are obtained by solving the Dirac equation~\eqref{eq:muonicEn} with the dual-kinetic-balance method~\cite{Shabaev2004}. Thereby, a complete set of muonic bound and continuum states is obtained. An overview for the binding energies of muon states important for the dynamic hyperfine splitting are shown in Table~\ref{tab:monopole}.

The quadrupole matrix elements can be calculated both for the rediagonalization in the dynamic hyperfine structure and for the evaluation of the residual second-order terms \eqref{eq:second}, using Eq.~\eqref{eq:quadNonDiagEl}. As the next step, the total Hamiltonian~\eqref{eq:muon_htotal} is diagonalized in finite subspaces or modelspaces consisting of the muonic ($2p\nicefrac{1}{2}$, $2p\nicefrac{3}{2}$) or ($3d\nicefrac{3}{2}$, $3d\nicefrac{5}{2}$) doublet states and nuclear ground state rotational band. For Rhenium, the first six states with $I_N \in \{5/2,...,15/2\}$ are considered, and for Uranium with $I_N \in \{7/2,...,17/2\}$. The excitation energies of the nuclear states are summarized, along with other nuclear parameters, in Table~\ref{tab:params}. Thereby, the composite states and corresponding energies $E_{\text{quad}}$ from Eq.~\eqref{eq:rediagonState} are obtained and finally, for each of these states the residual second order quadrupole correction \eqref{eq:second} is calculated. Here, the intermediate sum goes over all nuclear and muonic states not included in the modelspace.
Note that for the muonic ground state, a rediagonalization is not necessary, since the diagonal matrix elements of the quadrupole interactions vanish for muonic states with $j=1/2$.
The quadrupole-Uehling contribution to the binding energies can be obtained by performing the calculations for the dynamic hyperfine structure twice; once with the matrix elements both for the rediagonalization and for the residual second-order corrections containing both the electric and Uehling interaction ${V_{\text{el}}^{(2)}}{+}{V_{\text{uehl}}^{(2)}}$ and a second time only with the electric part ${V_{\text{el}}^{(2)}}$ from Eq.\eqref{eq:quadNonDiagEl}. The difference between those two approaches gives the quadrupole-Uehling corrections. Results for the residual second order quadrupole correction from Eq.~\eqref{eq:second} and for the quadrupole-Uehling corrections can be found in Table~\ref{tab:hfs_2} for a number of states.
%
To conclude the improved calculation of the higher order effects, the quadrupole interaction in the framework of the dynamic hyperfine structure in heavy muonic atoms was analyzed by an fully relativistic treatment of the quadrupole-Uehling potential and of the residual second order terms.
The quadrupole-Uehling interaction was obtained by a multipole expansion of the Uehling potential for an arbitrary nuclear charge distribution without the assumption on the distance between muon and nuclear charge being large.
Since it has the same angular structure as the conventional quadrupole interaction, the quadrupole-Uehling expectation value vanishes between two muonic states with $j=1/2$, thus it does not affect the muonic ground state.
The calculations for Uranium show that it can lead to energy corrections almost on the keV level for very heavy nuclei with muonic $2p$ states and thus can be potentially relevant for comparison between theoretical predictions and experiments. Being a short-ranged potential, it falls of quickly for states further away from the nucleus. For states with $n\geq3$, we find values below $0.15\,$keV, even for high Z.
The generalization to Uehling corrections for higher order multipole is straight forward. In the case of muonic atoms, since the influence of higher order multipoles is already small, we expect this correction will not contribute significantly.
The residual second order quadrupole corrections in the dynamic hyperfine structure were calculated numerically using a basis of relativistic wave functions including nuclear finite size correction and Uehling correction due to the monopole part of the nuclear potential.
In contrast to the first order terms, the muonic ground state energy is affected by the second order corrections. Here, the energy correction amounts up to several keV. Also for muonic $2p$ states, it is of similar size. For the $3d$ levels, we find the energy corrections below half a keV, both for Rhenium and Uranium.
If a more complete nuclear model instead the rotational model is used, the additional nuclear states appear as intermediate state in the second order corrections, leading to the nuclear polarization corrections. Therefore, the approach presented in this work provides a basis for an accurate treatment of the muonic spectrum for the nuclear polarization effect in deformed muonic atoms.

Overview of energy corrections due to residual second order electric quadrupole splitting~$\Delta E_{\text{2.ord.}}$ and quadrupole-Uehling interaction~$\Delta E_{\text{quad-uehl}}$ for $^{185}$Re and $^{235}$U. $F$ is the total angular momentum of muon and nucleus, $I_N$ is the nuclear angular momentum and $\mu$-state is the muonic state in spectroscopic notation. For the muonic $2p$ and $3d$ states, these are mixed by the dynamic hyperfine structure, thus $I_N$ (main) and $\mu$-state (main) show the states with the largest contribution. $E_{\text{quad}}$ is the binding energy without quadrupole Uehling and residual second order quadrupole interaction. The states are ordered descending in the total energy~$E_{\text{tot}}$. All energies are in keV.}
